management dimensions. [2] Each dimension represents a choice faced by
organisations regarding their approach to talent management. The findings
demonstrate that there is no ‘one size fits all’ methodology for talent management, and that many organisations view talent management as an overarching strategic priority rather than a series of ‘quick fix’, short-term initiatives.

The most effective approach to talent management is a unique blend of interventions, which are customised in relation to an organisation’s people, strategy, culture and technology.


The dimensions provide a useful starting point for the review of an organisation’s
approach to talent management, as well as highlighting areas for improvement. The four phases of the talent management journey are explained in this article, alongside the 13 dimensions.",management,,0.61777174

Modern slavery is a serious and brutal crime in which people are treated as commodities and exploited for criminal gain. It’s an international problem, and due to the nature of the crime, the true extent is unknown. What we do know is that it’s a growing issue, affecting men, women and children. This course is designed to help you understand what modern slavery is, who is affected, and what you should do if you spot the signs.

Key Insights

Who is affected? - Because modern slavery takes various forms, it affects males and females of all ages and races. How to spot the signs - Victims of modern slavery may be unwilling to come forward to law enforcement because they might not see themselves as victims, or they might fear further reprisals from their abusers.

This course is designed to raise the awareness of the global problem that is modern slavery and is targeted at all employees, regardless of position.

Unfortunately, too many meetings, whether virtual or in-person, waste your time and ruin your productivity for the day. This has resulted in meetings becoming something we dread, and it’s no secret that most of us would rather be, you know, working. But it doesn’t have to be that way.",,Innovation and problem solving,Score < threshold

Not only can this be profoundly unpleasant, it can seriously affect our health and our work. However, it is possible to manage stress, if you use the right tools and techniques. The tricky thing about stress (and the anxiety that comes with it) is that it’s an absolutely necessary emotion. Our brains are wired such that it’s difficult to take action until we feel at least some level of this emotional state. So there’s no escaping stress or magic pill to get rid of it. To beat the negative side of stress you have two choices:
Reduce the strain or boost your ability to weather its effects. Cutting pressure is ideal, but frankly, unlikely…
So it makes more sense to focus on improving your mental and physical ability to process stress.

Whether you're the instructor or the student, this has probably happened to most of us at some point in our lives. And it can be a frustrating experience.
All of us learn differently. Some people do best when they have visual cues, like graphs and diagrams. Others prefer to get INVOLVED with the learning, and perform experiments, or work in a group.
By taking the time to understand the different ways that people learn, you can adapt your approach to teaching others.
One of the best ways to do this is to use Felder and Silverman's Index of Learning Styles. According to this model, there are four dimensions that affect the way people learn.

Item,SMART Objectives learning bundle,"It’s all too easy to set objectives that are so general that we don’t know exactly what we’re trying to achieve, or whether we’ve achieved it. A structured approach forces us to think more deeply and methodically about what we actually want. Perhaps the best known of these approaches is the SMART acronym.
In this course, we explore the meaning behind the SMART acronym, and show you how to write objectives that inspire and motivate. The idea of SMART objectives is often credited to Peter Druker and his 1954 book “The Practice of Management”. But interestingly, there’s no direct reference to SMART in the book. It wasn’t until November 1981, in a publication called Management Review, the term was first documented. Since then, the SMART acronym has come to mean different things to different people. In this course we’ll focus on one of the most popular concepts, where SMART is an acronym for:
Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Relevant
Time-bound

The first of these are the trait theories. They explore the characteristics a good leader has. For instance, do you need integrity? Empathy? Assertiveness? Or all three? They examine which traits are most desirable and useful when you're in a leadership role.
The next group of theories look at behavior. What do the best leaders DO? For instance, do they bark instructions, or do they involve their team in decisions? Understanding the different approaches can help you decide how to behave as a leader.

Reduced costs. Thats why there has been an 80% increase in telecommuting staff over the last few years.
However, its something that can so easily go wrong. There are downsides like reduced motivation, poor communication and limited trust between team members.

But what if your fear is being interviewed?...
Well, you wouldn’t be alone. According to a recent study, over 90% of adults are anxious about job interviews.
Fear, nerves and stage fright can keep you from the job you want. And it’s easy to see why interviews can be nerve-wracking, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The scary interview situation is pretty easy to handle if you master a few basic tactics and techniques. This factsheet will help to lay them all out.
By the end, you’ll learn that confidence grows out of preparation. Nerves are normal, and why a wacky tie, might be a bad idea.

Item,Mental health at work,"The international monetary fund estimates that up to 5% of world GDP, or 1.5 trillion dollars is laundered each year. That’s roughly 6 billion pounds. With a maximum jail sentence of 14 years, do you know all you should about money laundering?
There are people in society who do things they’d rather not have the public know about and these people go to great lengths to hide any links between the money generated through criminal activity, from the final transaction when they spend their ill-gotten gains. They do this using a three stage method known as money laundering, and this course explains how the process works and your obligations under the applicable laws and regulations.
For:
• Anyone who works in the financial services sector
• Employees who would like to learn more about money laundering and their own responsibilities

Item,Bribery Act,"Each time a company pays a bribe it’s contributing, even in a small way, to perpetuating a system of corruption that embeds poverty and equality. Poorly equipped schools, counterfeit medicine and elections decided by money are just some of the consequences of corruption and bribery. Corruption is perhaps the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. This is why countries have gone to such great lengths to outlaw and combat corruption in many forms. In the UK, this takes the form of the Bribery Act 2010. It’s a serious bit of legislation designed to combat financial crime and has major implications for both companies and individuals. This course covers what you need to know and will help you understand your responsibilities under the act.

Item,RIDDOR,"RIDDOR requires deaths and injuries to be reported only when:
there has been an accident which caused the injury
the accident was work-related
the injury is of a type which is reportable
What is an ‘accident’?
In relation to RIDDOR, an accident is a separate, identifiable, unintended incident, which causes physical injury. This specifically includes acts of non-consensual violence to people at work.
Injuries themselves, eg ‘feeling a sharp twinge’, are not accidents. There must be an identifiable external event that causes the injury, eg a falling object striking someone. Cumulative exposures to hazards, which eventually cause injury (eg repetitive lifting), are not classed as ‘accidents’ under RIDDOR.
What is meant by ‘work-related’?
RIDDOR only requires you to report accidents if they happen ‘out of or in connection with work’. The fact that there is an accident at work premises does not, in itself, mean that the accident is work-related – the work activity itself must contribute to the accident. An accident is ‘work-related’ if any of the following played a significant role:
the way the work was carried out
any machinery, plant, substances or equipment used for the work or
the condition of the site or premises where the accident happened
What are ‘reportable’ injuries?
The following injuries are reportable under RIDDOR when they result from a work-related accident:
The death of any person (Regulation 6)
Specified Injuries to workers (Regulation 4)
Injuries to workers which result in their incapacitation for more than 7 days (Regulation 4)
Injuries to non-workers which result in them being taken directly to hospital for treatment, or specified injuries to non-workers which occur on hospital premises. (Regulation 5)",,Corporate eyecare,Score < threshold

Item,Working Flexibly,"At Specsavers, we are passionate about our people, and enabling everyone to be the best they can be.
As the working world becomes increasingly flexible, we need to ensure we are offering employees the same opportunities around how, when and where they work.
