Item,The Coaching Habit,"This program is a half-day course for leaders, managers, and executives, brought to Coast by Box of Crayons, experts in coaching and engagement. The program combines deep aha! moments about why a leader’s current way of managing and leading isn’t working so well (for them, for their team, or for the organization) with practical coaching tools so leaders can coach effectively in 10 minutes or less. With this new  understanding, leaders can more easily disarm the advice-giving “hairtrigger” and use their coaching skills when the occasion calls for it.
