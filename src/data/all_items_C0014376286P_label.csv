So if you want people to like you and/or don’t feel like spending the rest of your life in litigation, then this video is for you!",[],,[],communication,0
Item,Know What You Stand For (Part 5 of 13),"It’s hard to be ethical if you don’t know what you stand for. Thankfully, this video will help you figure that out. It will also reveal a shocking new use for your smartphone and one of the best fortune cookies ever. How do we fit so much awesomeness into a single video? Sometimes we’re not sure ourselves.",[],,[],mobile application,0
Item,Maintaining Your Statement of Values (Part 12 of 13),"A statement of values doesn’t do any good if nobody pays any attention to it. That’s where this video comes in. We’ll discuss how to make sure your ethical standards stay current and relevant. You also might be inspired to check your refrigerator when you get home, and you could possibly learn something amusing about seatbelts. So you can be assured that this is one ethics video you’re actually going to enjoy watching.",[],,[],soft skills,0

Item,Identifying Customer Types,"They say that everyone is a snowflake – sparkly, unique, and constantly in danger of melting. When it comes to customers, though, it turns out that we’re not all unique. In fact, there are only four main types of customers, and all of us fit into one of these categories every time we make a transaction. Naturally, then, those salespeople and customer service representatives who can identify what type of customer we are in a given interaction will be poised to make the most sales or provide the best customer experience.Identifying Customer Types is designed to help you do exactly that. For example, you’re probably aware that plenty of customers care first and foremost about how much sometime costs, but that doesn’t mean you always have to be the cheapest option. You’re also probably aware that training like this runs the risk of being as exciting as watching the credits at the end of a documentary about hamburger buns, which is why we’ve made sure to throw some hilarious (and wildly terrible) customer interactions in these videos to keep things interesting.You can’t be a great salesperson if you use the same pitch for everyone who walks through your door, and you can’t deliver an exceptional customer experience that way either. Identifying Customer Types will help you know exactly what to say to everyone you’re forced to do business with.",[],,[],customer relationship management,0

Item,Algebra Fundamentals 141,"Math: Algebra Fundamentals provides a detailed overview of the basics of algebra, including the operations needed to solve a single variable equation. Basic algebra is used constantly in manufacturing, from the production floor to the accounting department.Any time a number is unknown, algebra can be used to determine that missing value. Although algebra uses the same basic operations as other mathematics, there are several new operations used to find missing variables in problems. After taking this class, users will be able to simplify, factor, and balance basic equations, as well as calculate for missing values in equations with only one variable. The user will also be able to use algebra to create an equation based on a simple story problem.",[],,[],mathematics,0
Item,Geometry: Lines and Angles 151,"The class Geometry: Lines and Angles discusses the basic building blocks of all geometry: the line and the angle. Every print used in manufacturing is composed of lines and angles which must be interpreted to manufacture the depicted part. Though part geometry can be incredibly complex, all geometric prints can be broken down into simpler lines and angles. The relationships between the various angles formed when lines intersect can be used to solve geometry problems and interpret blueprints. An understanding of lines and angles is fundamental to learning and applying geometry as well as trigonometry and calculus. After taking this class, users should have a grasp on the types of lines and angles used in geometry, the angles that are formed by intersecting lines, and tranversals. An understanding of the basics of geometry is necessary in various fields including inspection, part program applications, and other important areas of manufacturing.",[],,[],mathematics,0
Item,Geometry: Triangles 161,"The class Geometry: Triangles discusses triangles and the specific mathematical operations unique to them. While the triangle is a very basic shape, it can be found as a part of more complex shapes. Triangles are often used as the basic shapes that compose three-dimensional CAD designs. Right triangles also form the basis of trigonometry. Since triangles are so commonly used, an understanding of the types of triangles and the methods for calculating missing information from them is essential to users.After taking this class, users will be able to categorize triangles by their sides and angles, calculate missing angles based on the measurements of other angles, and determine the area of a triangle.",[],,[],mathematics,0
Item,Geometry: Circles and Polygons 171,"Geometry: Circles and Polygons covers the specifics of geometry involving circles and polygons with any number of sides. The class includes a discussion on the internal angles of a circle as well as the method to calculate the circumference and area of a circle. Additionally, this class covers the calculation of missing angles in any polygonCircles and polygons, along with triangles, are the basic building blocks of any geometric figure. Knowledge of the calculations and uses of circles and polygons can prove useful when working with prints in any number of manufacturing capacities.",[],,[],mathematics,0
Item,Introduction to GD&T 301,"Introduction to GD&T provides a basic introduction to the symbols and vocabulary of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, or GD&T. GD&T is an international design standard that uses 14 standard geometric tolerances to control the shape of features. GD&T emphasizes the fit, form, and function of a part by comparing the physical features of the part to the imaginary datums specified in the design instructions. Every part feature is described by a series of symbols, which are organized in the feature control frame.Because GD&T uses tolerance zones that more accurately follow the shape of a feature rather than a square grid and emphasizes the relationship between features, blueprints usually utilitize GD&T to describe parts. This means that to fully understand a blueprint, it is necessary to know the GD&T symbols and what they mean. After taking this class, users should be able to better understand the symbols commonly used in a GD&T print.",[],,[],mathematics,0

Item,Trying Myers-Briggs,"At a meeting with Barney and Marcus, Serena claims that she introduced the concept of Myers Briggs personality testing to Cutting Edge.

There are 16 personality types identified. The staff have fun testing themselves to discover which combinations they are. There are no wrong or right answers; the MBTI is a means of working out better modes of communication and understanding between employees. Carol uncharacteristically acknowledges Sherrys contribution and makes it known that the original suggestion for the MBTI was Sherrys (the researcher at the bottom of the stairs).Please Note: These videos are designed to provoke discussion and response. They are fast paced; short; character-driven TV style comedies that take a new approach to reaching today's learners. By laughing; discussing; sharing outrage; and reacting to the behaviors on screen, we can use the resulting feelings and thoughts to develop a clearer shared view of how we want our teams to behave and to better manage these types of situations.

Item,Calibration Fundamentals 111,"The class Calibration Fundamentals provides a basic introduction to the importance of calibrating measuring instruments. Calibration determines the accuracy of measuring instruments by comparing its value to a higher-level measurement standard, usually a working standard gage block. Measurement standards follow a hierarchy consisting of primary, secondary, and working standards. Traceability links these standards together. Measurement uncertainty estimates the accuracy of a measurement. It is the range in which the true value of a measurement is expected to lie. High-accuracy parts require tight tolerances. Tighter tolerances require higher-accuracy measuring instruments. While uncertainty and error exists in every measurement, careful calibration can help to minimize inaccuracy when inspecting parts with measuring instruments. After taking this class, users should be able to explain how calibration and traceability impact the use and care of inspection devices.",[],,[],,
Item,Hole Standards and Inspection 141,"The class Hole Standards and Inspection provides a comprehensive introduction to hole inspection using contact instruments. Hole inspection ensures that a hole will meet its proper job specifications, including fit, diameter, roundness, and condition. Gaging instruments, like pin and plug gages, determine fit. Variable instruments determine size and must make three points of contact to find out-of-round conditions. Variable instruments may be mechanical, electronic, optical, or pneumatic. More complex handheld devices include telescoping gages, split-ball gages, calipers, inside micrometers, and bore gages.Job specifications, environmental concerns, and economic issues all determine which hole inspection device to use. Choosing the wrong tool could result in an out-of-tolerance hole passing inspection. After taking this class, users should be able to explain how to measure common hole features with plug gages, pin gages, and calipers and verify they are within tolerance.",[],,[],,
Item,Thread Standards and Inspection 151,"Thread Standards and Inspection explains the various parts of threads and how to inspect them. Manufacturers inspect threads according to unified or ISO standards or using System 21, System 22, and System 23. Several features must be checked to make sure that threads meet specifications. Gaging inspection tools, or go/no-go gages, simply determine whether or not a part will fit. Variable thread inspection tools determine whether a thread falls within a specified tolerance range. Thread type and specifications affect the tools used to inspect threads.Understanding the various components and classifications used to identify threads is critical for accurate inspection. After the class, the user will  be able to explain how to measure common threaded features with internal and external thread gages and verify the features are within tolerance.",[],,[],,
Item,Surface Texture and Inspection 201,"The class Surface Texture and Inspection provides information on surface finish and methods involved for its inspection. The surface finish achieved by a machining process determines how well a surface performs its given function. Surface inspection compares the specified nominal surface and real surface to find the measured surface. Measurement can be completed by comparison, direct measurement with a stylus-type instrument, or noncontact methods. A real surface contains irregularities (flaws, roughness, waviness, and lay) that make up its surface texture. Roughness is the most common irregularity used to inspect surfaces.The desired finish of a surface changes how precisely a part must be machined. Inspecting for surface roughness reduces the cost of surface finish by allowing companies to produce parts to customer specifications. After the class, users should be able to describe commonly used methods for tolerancing a part's surface roughness in a production environment.",[],,[],,

Item,Introduction to Sketch: Installing Sketch,"Before we dive into the program, we first need to download the software. Sketch can be downloaded at http://www.sketchapp.com/. Once you get to the page, press the 'Download Free Trial' button to start your free trial for 30 days. The free trial will have everything that the full version has -- just a limited timeframe to be able to use the program. After your trial has expired, be sure to purchase Sketch for $99/year to keep using it.",[],,[],,
Item,Sketch's Layer List: Introduction,"For our second chapter, we ll be teaching you how to use Sketch s Layers List feature to keep your document organized. Organization is a crucial skill for a designer to have. Many applications might seem simple enough, but you ll often need to be designing dozens, if not hundreds of screens. Staying organized will help you to work more smoothly, particularly when you re collaborating with other designers. We ll begin with showing you the Layers List s UI so that you can learn how your document is structured in Sketch. We ll then go over each of the hierarchical components of a Sketch document: pages, artboards, and layers. We ll finish up by showing you how to use each of these elements together to create a useful, organized design file.",[],,[],,
Item,Introduction to Sketch: Understanding Pages,"A page is exactly what you would think it is -- it is a page of your website or application. Think about it from a top-level perspective. If I was creating a generic website, I would create four pages: Home, About, Services, and Contact. You might have micro-interactions, or sub-pages of these parent pages, but you should always treat pages as your top level. This is the main structure to your Sketch file.",[],,[],,
Item,Sketch's Layer List: What Are Artboards For?,"Inside each page you will have the ability to insert an artboard. You can think of an artboard as the canvas to your web or mobile design. When creating an artboard you will be given several templates that can jumpstart your design, such as Apple devices, material design, responsive web, paper sizes, and, of course, custom. Regardless of the template that you select, you can always manipulate the sizing of it based on your project. Generally, I would proceed with the recommendations from Sketch as they are fairly accurate to start off, but if your project calls for a different dimension this is the opportunity to change it. Whatever you do, ensure you are consistent with the width of your artboards for your project. These are the actual pages of your design. Organize your artboards strategically within the canvas and be sure to create duplicates of your artboards for the various pages and states.",[],,[],,
Item,"Sketch's Layer List: Layers -- Selecting, Moving, Deleting, Locking, and Grouping","Each artboard contains a varying amount of layered items. These layered items can range from vector shapes and typography to icons and bitmapped images. Be sure to name your layers effectively so that you understand where things are and what elements are present. Here, you'll learn how you select a layer, move a layer, delete a layer, and lock a layer, and why grouping is important in the layering and asset structure.",[],,[],,
Item,"Sketch's Layer List: Using Artboards, Pages, and Layers Together",Here I will demo how structuring a basic website would consist of and amplify all of the above in this video simulation.,[],,[],,
Item,Inspector Panel in Sketch: Introduction,"In Chapter 3, we ll take a closer look at the Inspector Panel. Located on the far right of the interface, the Inspector Panel gives us a comprehensive set of options to mold and manage the selected layer. Understanding how to use the Inspector Panel will let you quickly and precisely edit several aspects of each object, such as transform, position, opacity, color, and much more. Using these tools correctly will let you create pixel-perfect designs. During the chapter, we ll break down the Inspector Panel one section at a time. We ll start with the alignment tools, which help you to arrange each object in relation to other objects and to the design as a whole. We ll then go over layer properties and resizing constraints, editing text fields with mouse keys and equations, making consistent and reusable designs with layer styles, and exporting your work to share with clients or collaborators.",[],,[],,
Item,Inspector Panel in Sketch: Alignment Options,"At the top of the Inspector you can find the Alignment Options. When designing an interface it is always best practice to ensure all elements are on a grid and form some sort of relation to other assets on the same page. The first two deal with distributing objects over a similar distance for both Vertical and Horizontal. The remaining six talks about how to orient objects together by aligning left, vertical, right, top, horizontal, and to the bottom. Aligning works with both a group of objects, as well as aligning it to an artboard. Always ensure that when designing you utilize this tool to ensure all elements have some sort of relation to others.",[],,[],,
Item,Inspector Panel in Sketch: Layer Properties and Resizing Constraints,"Layer properties are located underneath your alignment tools. Here you are able to control the position they are related to the artboard, the size of the artboard or layer and whether it is a fixed proportion, the ability to transform a shape, and flip them both vertically and horizontally. When selecting other shapes you will get different options, just like the ability to specify a corner radius when a rectangle is selected, or the number of points that a polygon can have. When selecting specific elements of Sketch there will be another portion of the interface that comes up that controls how objects are effected when a layer or artboard is resized -- whether they are fixed or not.",[],,[],,
Item,"Inspector Panel in Sketch: Text Fields, Mouse Keys, and Math Equations","Some text fields are normal and boring, but Sketch's text fields incorporate a bit of magic in them. When you click on a text box you have a lot of options on how to change value inside of it. Holding the up and down mouse keys increases its value by one, holding Shift increases the value by ten while holding the option button down increases or decreases it by a tenth of that size. You also have the ability to scrub your value back and forth to get very precise without the need to re-type a value. As if this wasn't enough, Sketch also always you to do basic equations such as +, -, *, or / to do quick basic math with a concrete value to use.",[],,[],,
Item,Inspector Panel in Sketch: Exporting,"At the bottom of your Inspector is the Export feature. This feature can also be accessed at the top bar by choosing Share Export or Shift-Command-E. When designing an interface you will want to export portions, or all of your design so that it can be translated to development, marketing collateral, or a prototyping software. You are able to export selected layers, grouped layers, and slices in convenient extensions.",[],,[],,
Item,Creating Elements in Sketch: How to Manage and Add Elements to Your Design,"Now that you have a thorough understanding of the interface and essential tools of Sketch, it s time to start creating elements. Creating and manipulating elements is at the core of design work, and setting their shape and layout precisely is one of the key factors of digital design. We ll start with creating shapes, which will typically form the backbone of most of your designs. Then we ll explore using Boolean operations to create shapes by designating relationships between multiple different shapes (it s easier than it sounds!). We ll follow that up with a look at editing text in Sketch, and we ll wrap up the chapter with a lesson in grouping objects.",[],,[],,
Item,Creating Elements in Sketch: Adding and Editing Shapes,"Adding a shape to Sketch couldn't be easier. You can either go to your top bar and click Insert Shapes Rectangle, or you can see the white plus button in the top left-hand corner that says insert. You will see a circular point in each of the corners. You can click and drag these points to modify the exact positioning. For example if you created a rectangle, but want it to be portrayed as a polygon instead, you can skew one of the points outwards. When you start extracting these points, it opens up the ability to have various point types which provide different affects. You can chose to have a straight point, a mirrored point, disconnected point, and an asymmetric point. The decision between one over the other is completely reliant on the application you are doing it for. You can also manipulate more than one point at a time by either clicking each point while holding down Shift, or highlighting over the points that you want to edit. After you have a defined shape, you are able to affect the Fill (solid color, linear gradient, radial gradient, angular gradient, and pattern and noise fills. You can also effect the blending of the fill you are using. In addition to being able to select a Fill, you can also define a border for the shape. You can position the border on the inside, center, or outside of your shape -- so you have the most functionality. When you scale your design, your border thickness will not scale, but remain the same. You also have the ability to convert your border to outline to counteract this.",[],,[],,
Item,Creating Elements in Sketch: Boolean Operations,"Sometimes it is more effective to bind the relationship of two states together to get a desired shape or outcome. This is where Boolean operations come handy. Located in the Top Bar slightly off center you will see 'Union, Subtract, Intersect, and Difference.' Union: The result is a vector that is the sum of both vector's areas. Subtract: The result is a vector where the area of the top shape is removed from the one under it. Intersect: The result is a vector consisting of the parts where the original shapes overlapped. Difference: The result is a vector that is exactly the part where they didn't overlap. It's the inverse of an intersect operation. Then talk about how manipulating the ordering of the layers changes the shapes outcome. When you initiate a Boolean Operation, you can still view the outlines of both of the shapes. To create a perfect and finalized instance, simply click the 'flatten' tool in the top of the screen.",[],,[],,
Item,Creating Elements in Sketch: Using Masking in Sketch,"Using Masks in Sketch are used to selectively show parts of other layers. Any shape can be turned into a mask, and vice versa any shape can be masked. Looking into your Layer List, you will notice that your mask will always be at the bottom, with indented lines suggesting that it has a parent mask presenting itself. If you don't want all subsequent layers to be clipped, the best way you can do this is allow the mask to be ignored. In order to do this, go to menu and chose Layer Mask Ignore Underlying Mask while your layer is selecting. Alternatively, you can right-click to get this option as well. When you double click inside of a mask you will see the ghost lines around the mask to showcase the size of the layer that is being masked.",[],,[],,
Item,Creating Elements in Sketch: Grouping Elements Together,"Entirely used for keeping your file organized, Groups let us designate like elements of a component and clumping them together and treating it as one entity. While this is one parent group, you can always double click inside to see the children layers inside. To group elements together, first you must select them all and hit Command G which will group your current selection. After you do so, you can rename the group to make the most sense of your artboard.",[],,[],,
Item,Organization and Consistency in Sketch: Layer Styles,"Shared Layer Styles allow you to attribute specific styling to an element. For example if you know that a generic button is going to be a Blue, but don't know what shade of blue yet, attaching the fill to a Layer Style will allow you to update on the fly if need be, everywhere in your document that shares that similar Layer Style. Think about Layer Styles as 'locking in' a current selection of styling to be used in other areas on your UI, but still have the ability to manipulate those values everywhere. Using Layer Styles improves your workflow and efficiency.",[],,[],,
Item,Organization and Consistency in Sketch: Symbols,"If you thought Layer Styles and Text Styles were cool, let's take a look at what Symbols can offer. A Symbol allows you to reuse elements easily across your document's Artboards and Pages. If there is a combination of elements that look like you can use them in other location in your UI design, you will want to clump them together and form a Symbol. Doing so will create an 'Instance' on the individual page, and will create another page labeled 'Symbols' in which will act as the 'Master' to all of the other 'Instances' below it. To edit a symbol, go to the 'Master' and manipulate the positioning of the elements. Using symbols can range anywhere from creating and reusing a navigational item, a footer, or even a button. What is even more cool about Symbols is that you can use overrides to be more custom. For example, an application should always have a similar button style. After solidifying what your button would look like, you would create a symbol from it. After inserting the symbol to where you would like it and clicking on the symbol, you will get more directions from the Inspector where you can post textual overrides on your symbol. If you don't want your button to say 'Submit' but rather 'Let's Proceed,' you can override that value here. If you need to change your button style down the line, not only can you do that to the 'Master' symbol, but you can also attach a text or layer style and nest them inside a symbol for even greater control.",[],,[],,
Item,Organization and Consistency in Sketch: Naming Conventions,"As you can tell, having the power to utilize these features in Sketch opens up a wide range of possibilities. What is critical at this stage is that you start your document with proper naming conventions. The basic rule to naming conventions is to allow it to be intuitive -- enough for you to understand it and for another designer to hop inside your document and understand what is happening. For Layer Styles that reflect a fill color; use the color you are representing. If it is a red, call it 'Red.' For particular applications you can get a little more specific, just remain consistent. For Text Styles try to think about it as if you were translating this to a front-end developer. They are accustomed to CSS styling naming conventions such as 'H1, H2, H3, H4, Input, Placeholder, etc.' so try to use similar naming conventions to make the translation from design to development as seamless as possible.",[],,[],,
Item,Exporting Assets From Sketch: Introduction,"In Chapter 6, we re going to demonstrate each of your options for exporting your designs from Sketch into other formats. Many of your clients or other non-designer collaborators won t have Sketch, and you ll need to convert your designs into another file type for them to view, such as a PDF or PNG. To start, we ll cover your basic options for exporting your pages, artboards, and layers. Then, we ll show you how to make certain layers exportable even when they aren t by default. We ll take a look at Sketch Mirror, which lets you preview your design and check sizing and positioning. After that, we ll introduce you to using InVisionApp to make an interactive prototype out of your Sketch design. We ll finish by going over naming conventions and file optimization to make sure that your exports are organized and relatively lightweight.",[],,[],,
Item,Exporting Assets from Sketch: How to Export and What Extensions Are Allowed,"To share your designs, you can either chose 'Share Export' from the top menu bar, or you can click on the export item in the toolbar. After being given this option it will scour your entire document to see what elements you can export. Doing this all in one go is fairly easy, but you can also click on an individual element, or group of layers, and click on the 'Make Exportable +' button in your Inspector at the bottom. Doing so will allow you to select what size you want it rendered at, if it requires a prefix/suffix, and what format. The available formats are: PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG, EPS, TIFF, and WEBP.",[],,[],,
Item,Exporting Assets from Sketch: Creating Exportable Layers,"You can granular enough to export a singular icon, but what about exporting a group of layers, a symbol, a masked item, or even an object that has been effected by a Boolean operation and has been pathfinded? Be sure to strategically export which layers you want. One rule that can be used for best practice is to never save out a text rich field as a bitmapped PNG or JPG.",[],,[],,
Item,Exporting Assets from Sketch: Previewing Design on Sketch Mirror,"Sketch Mirror is a tool made by sketch that allows you to visualize your design in real time to test sizing, effectiveness, and positioning .",[],,[],,
Item,Exporting Assets from Sketch: Test Your Prototype With InVision,"InVision app is a prototyping software that combines your artboards as screens and allow you to put hotspots on areas to simulate navigation and interaction. If designing a multi-page website, or an intricate application is something you are currently doing, then I highly suggest using InVision to prototype your Sketch designs. Not only can you do this directly in Sketch, but you can update on the fly and make important strategic decisions by the feedback you receive.",[],,[],,
Item,Exporting Assets from Sketch: Proper Naming Conventions and Optimizing your Assets,"Once you export your files and have named them accurately, what is the best method to optimize them for fast load render on the web? One thing that is important to understand is Sketch does not optimize your assets. Saving out a masthead image with heavy photography will result in a file size larger than 1MB. Typically, for assets on the web, you want to be well under 1MB to ensure fast speed load. You can optimize your assets using a varying of techniques. You can use an alternative program to drag your newly created asset in and reduce the file size that way, or you can visit tinypng.com that will dramatically down sample your bitmap to ensure fast page load. An alternative that can also be done is exporting vectors as SVG. A Scalable Vector Graphic is actually an image that is created using an exact formula and exists in code. Exporting an icon, for example, as an SVG will allow you to scale up that tiny icon and still maintain the same proportions and 'hard line' that vectors grant. Lastly, the best method to get in the habit is the following naming convention when exporting assets: type-item(-variant).format. For example, a Facebook icon would be icon-facebook-blue.png.",[],,[],,
Item,Building a Mobile Interface With Sketch: Creating a Wireframe and a High-Fidelity Wireframe,"After understanding the user stories and the feature sets that need to go into an application and you have a basic understanding of how the layout will be, start piecing together the design in a grayscale color scheme to emphasize placement, sizing, and content. There are various ways to go about this, but I prefer creating high fidelity wireframes over a basic wireframe. Not only does this jumpstart the final design, but you can actually get context from where text should be, how much text should be there, and if relating it to an image is effective or not. The messages are directly relational to the UX of the application, so to provide as much context as possible is important.",[],,[],,
Item,Using InVision App's Craft Plugin in Sketch: Introduction,"One of the most important things to remember about UI/UX design is that what you re creating will eventually need to be a fully-functional, interactive experience. With InVisionApp and its Sketch plugin Craft, you can make your designs interactive, giving you and your client a chance to see how the interface will look and feel without needing to have a developer actually build the application. To get started, we ll show you how to download and install Craft. Then, we ll give you an overview of Craft Sync, which will automatically sync your artboards with an InVisionApp project. Next, we ll teach you how to use Craft Library to share your InVisionApp prototype, use actual data in your prototype with Craft Data, duplicate elements with Craft Duplicate, and write directly on your prototype with Craft Freehand.",[],,[],,
Item,Using InVision App's Craft Plugin in Sketch: Craft Sync,"Craft sync allows you to login to your InVision app account and sync all of your artboards, or selective ones, to an already created project that will allow your client to test, comment, and critique your product.",[],,[],,
Item,Using InVision App's Craft Plugin in Sketch: Craft Freehand and Stock,"Freehand allows you to write on top of your design to provide that feedback for quick context to areas, improvements, and suggestions. Also, with Craft Stock you have the ability to pull images directly from iStock or Getty Images.

Item,Trying Myers-Briggs,"At a meeting with Barney and Marcus, Serena claims that she introduced the concept of Myers Briggs personality testing to Cutting Edge. Dion explains that the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI ) was first developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. Its based on Carl Jungs theory of four principal psychological functions by which we experience the world: sensation, intuition, feeling and thinking and there are four dichotomies: Extravert or Introvert, Sensing or Intuition, Thinking or Feeling, Judging or Perceiving. There are 16 personality types identified. The staff have fun testing themselves to discover which combinations they are. There are no wrong or right answers; the MBTI is a means of working out better modes of communication and understanding between employees. Carol uncharacteristically acknowledges Sherrys contribution and makes it known that the original suggestion for the MBTI was Sherrys (the researcher at the bottom of the stairs).Please Note: These videos are designed to provoke discussion and response. They are fast paced; short; character-driven TV style comedies that take a new approach to reaching today's learners. By laughing; discussing; sharing outrage; and reacting to the behaviors on screen, we can use the resulting feelings and thoughts to develop a clearer shared view of how we want our teams to behave and to better manage these types of situations. These programs partner well with the Switch On and/or Workplace Excellence series, also by Seven Dimensions.This program does not include a quiz.
