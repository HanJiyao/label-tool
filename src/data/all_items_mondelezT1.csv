,Preparing a Business Case,"

Why put time and effort into preparing, writing, and presenting a business case for new projects? Why not just talk to the manager and get his approval for the project? The answers to these questions lie in the fact that organizational budgets for new projects are typically very tight and, as such, your project will be competing against other projects for funding. Without a written business case, your chances of persuading decision makers within your organization to implement your new project idea, instead of a competing project, stand little chance. This course prepares learners interested in the development of effective business cases. You will learn what a business case is and when one is used, what research you need to do before you start to write a business case, and what information should be included in your business case. Finally, you will learn how to plan and position your business case to maximize its effectiveness.

,Adressieren und Weiterleiten von E-Mails,"
Bei wie vielen E-Mails, die Sie in der letzten Arbeitswoche empfangen haben, haben Sie sich insgeheim gefragt, warum Sie sie erhalten? Bei wie vielen dieser E-Mails haben Sie sich gefragt, was diese E-Mails überhaupt mit Ihnen zu tun haben? Da E-Mails im heutigen Geschäftsalltag die Hauptkommunikationsform sind, ist es besonders wichtig, dass beim Versenden von E-Mails die Verteilerliste stimmt. Das Senden von E-Mails an die falsche Person oder das Ausschließen der richtigen Person ist genauso ineffektiv, wie wenn Sie eine falsche Telefonnummer wählen, trotzdem eine Nachricht hinterlassen und erwarten, dass die richtige Person zurückruft. In diesem Kurs werden die Methoden für eine wirksame Adressierung und Weiterleitung von E-Mails behandelt. Im Besonderen werden Ihnen bewährte Vorgehensweisen für die Entscheidung aufgezeigt, an wen Sie E-Mails senden sollten und wie Sie E-Mails angemessen kennzeichnen. In diesem Kurs werden auch die Regeln der Etikette für das Weiterleiten von E-Mails und die Verwendung der Funktionen „Antworten“ und „Allen antworten“ behandelt. Abschließend werden darüber hinaus die Empfindlichkeiten behandelt, die entstehen können, wenn eine E-Mail ohne Zustimmung an andere weitergeleitet wird.

,Adressage et redistribution d'emails,"
Combien de fois la semaine dernière êtes-vous resté perplexe face à l'un de vos nombreux emails en vous demandant pourquoi vous le receviez ? Combien de fois vous êtes-vous demandé pour quelle raison exactement tous ces emails vous étaient adressés ? Les emails sont aujourd'hui l'une des formes de communication les plus courantes dans le monde du travail. Il est donc crucial de savoir les adresser correctement. Adresser un email au mauvais destinataire (ou oublier de l'adresser au destinataire principal) s'avère tout aussi inefficace que composer un faux numéro sur un téléphone, laisser un message sur le répondeur, puis attendre que la personne que vous cherchiez à joindre vous rappelle. Ce cours présente les techniques permettant d'adresser et de redistribuer correctement vos emails. Il explore plus particulièrement les bonnes pratiques pour décider à qui les envoyer et comment définir leur priorité de manière correcte. Ce cours présente également la marche à suivre pour transférer des emails et utiliser les options « Répondre » et « Répondre à tous ». Il traite enfin du fait de mettre un email en copie sans en aviser le destinataire principal et des conséquences que cela peut avoir.

Per quante di quelle e-mail ti sei chiesto che cosa avevano a che fare realmente con te? Oggigiorno, la sempre maggiore diffusione delle e-mail come una delle forme principali di comunicazione commerciale rende essenziale prestare particolare attenzione alla lista di distribuzione, evitando di commettere errori. L'invio di un'e-mail alla persona sbagliata o, al contrario, l'assenza fra i destinatari di quella giusta è un'operazione inutile, esattamente come comporre il numero di telefono sbagliato, lasciare un messaggio e attendere di essere richiamati dalla persona giusta. Questo corso illustrerà le tecniche necessarie per indirizzare e redistribuire le e-mail in modo corretto. Nello specifico, introdurrà alle pratiche migliori da adottare nella selezione del destinatario delle e-mail e nel corretto contrassegno di queste tramite i flag. Il corso, inoltre, offrirà una panoramica del galateo applicato all'inoltro delle e-mail e all'uso della risposta a uno o tutti i destinatari.

,Business Writing: Know Your Readers and Your Purpose,"
To write effective and appropriate business messages, you need to know your readers. Are you addressing multiple readers or a single reader? How much knowledge do your readers have of your subject, and what issues concern them most? These are just some of the questions to consider before you start writing your message. Closely tied with knowing your readers is knowing your purpose for writing. Do you need to inform customers about a new policy, or do you need to persuade employees to adopt a new business practice? Knowing your purpose will focus your message, making it clear to readers why it is important to them. In addition, identifying who your audience is and what your purpose is will guide you in selecting an appropriate tone for your business message. Tone is a significant element in writing – one that affects how the reader will respond to your message. Tone refers to the writer's attitude toward the reader and subject matter as expressed in the way the message is written. Have you ever received a memo that annoyed you by its tone? For example, it might have been patronizing or too familiar. The key to controlling the tone of your writing is to put yourself in the place of your reader. And you need to carefully choose the words that will create the right tone for your message. When you know who your readers are and what your purpose is, you can tailor your tone to suit them. This will help you create more effective business messages. This course addresses ways to identify your readers and to create messages that convey the appropriate tone for different reader roles. It also outlines how to write effectively for the three most common reasons for writing a business document – to inform, respond, or persuade.",business writing,,keyword match
,商务写作：了解读者和写作目的,"
撰写恰当有效的商务信函需要先了解读者。你面对的是一个读者还是多个读者？读者对你所讨论的主题了解多少？他们最关心哪些问题？这些只是你在开始写作之前要考虑的诸多问题之一。与了解读者紧密相关的是认清写作目的。你是要向客户通报一项新政策，还是要说服雇员采用新的业务方式？了解了写作目的，你才能明确信函的中心主题，才能使读者清晰地认识到，为什么这些信息对他们来说是重要的。 此外，识别受众和写作目的有助于你为商务信函选择恰当的语调。语调是写作中的一个重要因素 -- 它影响读者对信函的反应方式。语调是指从写作方式中体现出来的作者对读者和主题所持的态度。你是否曾经收到过语调让你不快的备忘录？例如语气居高临下或没大没小。在写作过程中掌握语调的关键是把自己想象成读者，进行换位思考。你应该谨慎地措辞，为信函营造恰当的语调。当你知道了读者是谁、写作目的是什么时，你就可以相应地调整语调。这有助于你写出更加有效的商务信函。 本课程讲解识别读者的方法，以及如何针对不同的读者写出语调得体的商务信函。本课程还简述了如何通过有效的写作达到商务写作最常见的目的 -- 通知、回应和说服。 本课程是针对中文读者专门设计的以英文为基础的基本商务写作语法课程。课程中的语法和书面表达方式体现了美式英语的实际运用情形和相应的美式商务写作风格。课程以中文教授，但是所有例子都将保留为美式英语形式。

Konflikte können viele Ursachen haben: Uneinigkeit über Aufgabenverteilungen und Vorgehensweisen sowie Meinungsverschiedenheiten, die auf unterschiedliche Persönlichkeiten und Stile zurückzuführen sind. Es ist unvermeidlich, dass Konflikte am Arbeitsplatz entstehen. Daher ist es wichtig, dass sie erfolgreich gelöst werden können. Wenn Sie Konflikte vermeiden, die schnelles und entschiedenes Handeln erfordern, oder eine aggressive Haltung einnehmen, wenn Sie die Unterstützung der anderen Person benötigen, können Sie die Situation verschlimmern. Ungelöste Konflikte können sich verschärfen und Ihre Produktivität beeinträchtigen, da Sie sich mehr mit dem Konflikt als mit Ihren eigentlichen Zielen beschäftigen. Und bedenken Sie, dass der Preis für einen anhaltenden Konflikt hoch sein kann: negative Emotionen, gestörte Kommunikation und Stress. Die Auswahl der angemessenen Strategie für den jeweiligen Konflikttyp ist wichtig. Wenn Sie Konflikte richtig angehen, entstehen für Sie eine Reihe von Vorteilen. Beispielsweise können sie Ihre Kreativität fördern und Ihre Beziehungen stärken. Dieser Kurs beschreibt diese und weitere Vorteile von Konflikten. Er erläutert zudem die verschiedenen Konfliktsituationen, die am Arbeitsplatz auftreten können, und beschreibt abhängig vom gewünschten Ergebnis angemessene Strategien.

,Conflictos en el lugar de trabajo: reconocimiento de los conflictos y respuesta ante ellos,"
Los conflictos pueden tener muchas causas, como desacuerdos sobre quién hace cada cosa o cómo se hacen las cosas, así como desacuerdos relacionados con las personalidades y los estilos. Inevitablemente surgen conflictos en el lugar de trabajo, por lo que es de extrema importancia poder afrontarlos de forma satisfactoria. Si se evita un conflicto que requiere una acción rápida y decisiva o si se adopta una postura agresiva cuando se necesita obtener el compromiso de la otra persona, es posible que se empeore la situación. Los conflictos sin resolver pueden intensificarse y mermar la productividad, puesto que se invierte más tiempo en preocuparse por el conflicto que en lograr las metas. Y recuerde, los costes de un conflicto prolongado pueden ser altos en términos de emociones negativas, bloqueo de comunicaciones y estrés. Sin embargo, es importante elegir la respuesta adecuada en función del tipo de conflicto. Al afrontar un conflicto en forma adecuada se obtienen varios beneficios: por ejemplo, puede ayudar a aumentar la creatividad y reforzar las relaciones entre las personas. En este curso se describen estos y otros beneficios de los conflictos. También se explican los distintos tipos de situaciones conflictivas que pueden enfrentarse en el lugar de trabajo y se describen respuestas adecuadas en función del resultado que se desee.

Si vous évitez un conflit qui nécessiterait une action rapide et décisive, ou encore si vous avez un comportement agressif alors que vous auriez besoin du soutien de votre interlocuteur, vous pouvez aggraver la situation. Un conflit non résolu peut s'accentuer et ralentir votre productivité si vous passez davantage de temps à vous soucier du conflit qu'à atteindre vos objectifs. Souvenez-vous également que les coûts d'un conflit prolongé peuvent être élevés : émotions négatives, communication impossible et stress.

,職場での衝突: 衝突の認識とその対応,"
衝突が発生する原因は、仕事の割り当てや進め方に関する意見の不一致、性格やライフスタイルに関する意見の不一致など、多岐にわたります。 職場で衝突が発生するのは避けられないことであり、そのため衝突を適切に扱う能力が重要になります。 迅速で確固とした処置を必要としている衝突を単に回避したり、他の人の合意を得る必要があるときに攻撃的なアプローチをしたりすると、状況を悪化させてしまうことがあります。 未解決の衝突は激化する可能性があり、目標の達成より衝突に関する懸念事項に多くの時間を奪われて生産性が下がることがあります。 また、長期化した衝突による損失は大きく、否定的な感情、コミュニケーションの阻害、ストレスなどの弊害が発生します。 そのため、衝突のタイプに応じた適切な対応を選択することが重要です。 衝突を適切に扱うことには多くのメリットがあります。 たとえば、創造性が向上したり、人間関係が強固になったりします。 このコースでは、衝突がもたらすこれらのメリットやその他のメリットについて説明します。 また、職場で発生しやすい衝突の状況のタイプ、および望ましい結果に応じた適切な対応についても説明します。

Konflikt może mieć wiele przyczyn – różnica zdań co do tego, kto ma co zrobić bądź jak należy coś zrobić, jak również rozbieżność związana z osobowością i osobistym stylem. A konflikty nieuchronnie powstaną w miejscu pracy, dlatego krytyczna jest umiejętność skutecznego radzenia sobie z nimi. Jeżeli unikasz konfliktu, który wymaga szybkiego i zdecydowanego działania, bądź jeśli stosujesz podejście agresywne, gdy potrzebne jest uzyskanie czyjegoś zobowiązania, pogarszasz sytuację. Nierozwiązany konflikt może się nasilić i pogorszyć Twoją produktywność, skoro spędzasz więcej czasu na zajmowaniu się konfliktem, niż na realizacji celów. I pamiętaj, koszty wydłużonych konfliktów mogą być wysokie – negatywne emocje, zablokowana komunikacja i napięcie nerwowe. Ale wybór właściwej reakcji opartej na typie konfliktu jest ważny. Kiedy odpowiednio zareagujesz na konflikt, doświadczysz wielu korzyści: może on ulepszyć Twoją kreatywność i np. wzmocnić Twoje stosunki międzyludzkie.

Jeder Mensch gerät in Situationen, in denen er ohne Verhandeln nicht weiterkommt. Gute Verhandlungstechniken können am Arbeitsplatz und auch in anderen Bereichen entscheidend sein. Voraussetzung für ein erfolgreiches Verhandeln ist, dass Sie einige Grundlagen kennen und verstehen. Das Konzept des Verhandelns lässt sich auf verschiedene Arten beschreiben, beispielsweise könnte es als das Erreichen gewünschter Ziele definiert werden, das Erzielen einer Einigung, das Beeinflussen anderer Personen oder auch als Handeln im Sinne von Feilschen. Wie Sie es auch betrachten, Verhandeln ist immer als Prozess zu sehen, in dem zwei oder mehr Parteien mit unterschiedlichen Bedürfnissen und Zielen zusammenarbeiten, um eine für alle Seiten annehmbare Lösung zu finden. In diesem Kurs erhalten Sie eine Definition von Verhandeln, und Sie lernen Techniken kennen, die erfolgreiche Verhandlungen fördern. Außerdem werden distributive und integrative Verhandlungen erläutert: die beiden in geschäftlichen Zusammenhängen üblichen Verhandlungstechniken.

So kann zum Beispiel eine Präsentation enorm verbessert werden, wenn Sie diesen drei wichtigen Schritten ausreichend Zeit und Aufmerksamkeit schenken: Analyse Ihrer Zuhörer, Strukturierung Ihrer Ideen und Auswahl einer geeigneten Präsentationsmethode. Dieser Kurs beschreibt, wie Sie eine Präsentation mithilfe dieser Schritte erfolgreich planen können.

,Basic Presentation Skills: Creating a Presentation,"
Among the fears that people have about giving a presentation is that they will get mixed up, forget to make a key point, or repeat themselves. One way to avoid this is to have a sound structure. Once you have identified the purpose and audience for the presentation, and come up with some ideas for what to say, you can transform those ideas into a script or notes that will guide you through the presentation. You should start with an introduction, where you grab the attention of the audience and tell what you are going to do. Next, you need to support each of your key points and, at the same time, not lose the attention of the audience. At the end of your presentation, you need to give your audience a clear understanding of what happens next. You also must make your ending compelling. After all, this is how the audience will remember you. This course describes how to make these key parts of a presentation – the introduction, support content, and conclusion – memorable and effective. It also explains the purposes for which different presentation aids are used, as well as how to use visuals appropriately. Finally, this course describes how to rehearse a presentation – a key step in building confidence for the real thing.",presentation,Fundamental Skills,0.7805677

人们在发表演讲时会担心语序混乱、忘记关键点或重复内容。 一个可以避免这种情况的方法是采用合理的结构。 在确定演讲的目标和观众之后，对演讲内容进行构思，再将这些想法变成讲稿或笔记，引导您完成演讲。 您应先从介绍开始，吸引观众的注意力，告诉他们您要讲些什么。接下来，您要支持每个关键点，同时不能失去观众的注意力。 在演讲结束时，您要让观众清楚地知道接下来会发生什么， 还要让结束语具有说服力。 毕竟，要用这种方式让观众记住您。 本课将讨论如何让演示文稿的主要部分令人难忘而又有效，即介绍、支持内容和结论。 并将说明不同演讲辅助工具的用途以及如何正确使用直观辅助工具。 最后，本课将介绍如何排练演讲 -- 为真实演讲树立信心的关键步骤。

Präsentationen sind immer dann besonders erfolgreich, wenn Vortrag und Inhalt von gleich hoher Qualität sind. Es ist möglich, dass Sie den Inhalt einer Präsentation sorgfältig geplant und strukturiert haben. Wenn Sie dann jedoch Ihre Botschaft monoton und in steifer Haltung herunterleiern, wird es Ihnen vermutlich nicht gelingen, die Zuhörer für sich zu gewinnen. Nach einer gewissenhaften Präsentationsvorbereitung sollten Sie deshalb sicherstellen, dass auch Ihr Vortrag attraktiv gestaltet ist.

Excellence in presentation can be achieved when the standard of your delivery matches the quality of your content. You may have carefully planned and structured what you want to say, but if you deliver your message in a monotone while standing stiffly, you're probably not going to captivate the audience.

In this course, you'll see how conversations with different people in different situations can impact how you deliver your message, in terms of respect and sensitivity. By exploring the impact of environment, relationships, and communication style, this course shows you how to recognize the delicacy of different situations. It also demonstrates how you can adjust or adapt your communication style to ensure you communicate with diplomacy and tact.",communications,Communicate with Diplomacy and Tact,0.99888366
,Strategies for Communicating with Tact and Diplomacy,"Communicating with diplomacy and tact requires strategy, awareness, and skills. Its aim is to establish trust and rapport in relationships while delivering messages effectively. However, it's often pushed aside by good intentions cloaked by gut reaction and misinterpretation.

As well as exploring what you should say, the course shows you how you can use proper timing and delivery when conveying your message. This will enable you to deliver messages tactfully and diplomatically, without sacrificing your reputation or professional relationships.",communications,Communicate with Diplomacy and Tact,0.9985045

This course explores the skills needed to help you effectively plan and deliver your difficult message. It helps you learn how to develop and frame your message by examining issues such as careful preparation, wording, and delivery.

,Interpersonal Communication that Builds Trust,"
Communication works best when your intention is clear, your audience is engaged, and your verbal and nonverbal behavior are respectful. When you hit these notes, you'll build trust with the people you communicate with. To maintain that trust, you also have to be aware of and manage emotions – yours and those of others. In this course, you'll explore how a clear intention drives a communication, and how understanding your audience ensures that the message gets delivered. You'll also learn how verbal signals, nonverbal behavior, and emotional intelligence can help make or break your communications.",communications,Fundamental Skills,0.9983
,Communication Methods that Make Sense – and Make Your Point,"
Today people rely more and more on mobile devices and 'one-way' communication tools that they often use under the guise of being 'social.' Although it's possible to learn to communicate interpersonally using only technology, it's not always the best or most efficient way to achieve your intended communication outcomes, which are most typically to inform, give feedback, or influence. Interpersonal communication is just that – personal. So the further you stray from communication methods that are rich in personal attributes (you can hear someone, see someone, use body language, interact with others) versus light in personal attributes (impersonal, one-way, static), the more apt you are to have a one-way, 'telling' type of communication. In this course, you'll learn how to select the best communication methods to convey your intention and target your audience. By doing so, you improve the odds of getting your message across, making your point, and leaving your audience feeling informed, enlightened, and engaged.",communications,Fundamental Skills,0.9978205
,Being a Receptive Communication Partner,"
Interpersonal communication is a two-way street. The 'giver' has the lion's share of responsibility in making sure the communication conveys the correct intent and message. But no one likes to talk to a wall, so in many ways, the response from the communication recipient is as important as the message that's given. When you're on the receiving end of a communication, regardless of whether or not it has been planned or delivered effectively, you must try to be receptive and understand what was intended. This requires two essential skills that most everyone finds challenging to keep sharpened: listening and questioning. In this course, you'll work on sharpening those skills – as well as on getting yourself in the right receptive mind-set for communicating.",communications,Fundamental Skills,0.9987987
,Communication Challenges: Navigating Choppy Waters,"
Everyone has experienced miscommunication. Have you ever dealt with someone who seems unable to 'hear' the message you're sending? Or have you ever had to deliver a message that you knew would be hard for the other person to accept? Maybe you've even found yourself in a disagreement with someone that was so significant that it completely shut down your communication. Communication gets tough when the message is difficult. And because these challenges typically involve emotions such as hurt, anger, or confusion, it's not uncommon for people to avoid one another or shut down, preventing what could be a productive exchange at many levels. In this course, you'll examine some common communication challenges and how you can successfully navigate them. By showing patience, perseverance, and accountability, you can get communication back on track and reach mutual understanding and agreement.",communications,Fundamental Skills,0.9985557

Conflict, when hurtful or unresolved, puts distance between people who need to work together, and often results in a loss of talent. 'Not getting along' shouldn't be the reason people fail to contribute or leave organizations. Dealing with conflict when it is in your face is one thing, but preventing it comes first. This means accepting that conflict may occur, understanding the sources of potential conflict, preventing unnecessary conflict by watching for signs, and making sure you and others know what is 'off limits.'

You'll find out how to recognize the signs of unhealthy conflict and take steps to prevent it.

When you are dealing with workplace conflict, emotions get stirred up, and many people want conflict to 'go away.' But in most cases it won't go away on its own, so you need to choose a course of action. Sometimes it just means making peace with yourself or a situation. Other times, you may need to make trade-offs. If your choice is to deal with it straight on, you need a process.

Perhaps you have a more cooperative approach? When working with others who have different styles, and when facing different conflict situations, we all have to adapt. In this course, you'll learn about the different conflict styles, including when and how to use them. You'll find out about the importance of adapting your style in response to others' styles and the particular situation you're in. Finally, you'll learn how to deal with a difficult individual in a conflict situation.",soft skills,Fundamental Skills,0.99568945
,Issue-focused Negotiation: Are You Ready?,"
People often see negotiation as a matter of sticking to your 'position' while playing tug-o-war. But taking 'positions' involves an emotional/ego component inevitably leading to a dead end in negotiation. Instead, focus on the issue at hand, and learn strategies to communicate effectively and avoid falling into 'positions.' It takes the right mindset, essential communication skills and a toolbox of strategies to deftly handle any tricks the other party tries to use on you. This course will teach you how to stop playing...and stop being played.",negotiation,Fundamental Skills,0.9981363
,You and Your Negotiating Counterpart,"
We all have emotions, motivations, and unique personalities. You'll need to accept and integrate that into your negotiating strategy. Most people are so busy with their own interests that they do not fully realize the other person's issues. This course will help you build critical components of a good negotiating relationship, including mutual trust, a deeper understanding of where your negotiation counterpart is coming from, a set of techniques to use when faced with different personalities, and a plan for getting them to come along with you.",negotiation,Fundamental Skills,0.99817634
,Reaching a Negotiated Agreement,"
At this point in the negotiation, you've done what you can to establish a trusting relationship, kept focused on the issues, and adapted your approach to optimize your influence with your counterpart. The finish line may be in sight, but it's not yet a guarantee. The object of negotiation is to come to and confirm an agreement. When you started the negotiation you asked questions. At this point you're focusing on the answers. In this course, you'll learn how to think creatively about solutions to maximize your chances of arriving at a mutually beneficial agreement with your negotiating counterpart. You'll also learn how to facilitate that agreement – even amid resistance from the other party.",negotiation,Fundamental Skills,0.9941801
,Emotional Intelligence: Owning Your Emotions,"Emotions arise within ourselves – through our complex brain circuitry that we sometimes call 'wiring.' No one else is responsible for our emotions – we own them, and we must be aware of them in order to manage them, recognize them in others, and develop relationships. External stimuli may trigger our sensations, reactions, and responses but to be emotionally intelligent you must start 'in here' (inside yourself) and not 'out there.' When triggered, your brain gets fired up and you might feel afraid, anxious, angry, shocked, or sad. You may also feel happy, joyful, excited, and fulfilled. When you are intelligent about your emotions, you're aware that the hardest work is managing the emotions that get in the way of your best performance.",emotional intelligence,Developing Your Emotional Intelligence,0.9404521
,Emotional Intelligence: Building Self-Management Skills,"Probably the most essential skill involved in Emotional Intelligence is self-management. It usually rides on the tail of self-awareness…when you notice an emotion. What can happen is that an emotional response takes on a life of its own, gets hijacked, or snowballs into a reaction that is difficult to control. With self-management skills, you nip it in the bud and control the inward interpretations and outward behaviors associated with strong emotions. You not only self-manage in the moment but you begin to regulate how you typically respond to things that push your buttons. You build a proactive approach to emotional intelligence – first with your awareness and then a natural flow into self-management. Another reason why self-management is so important is that with it, the relational side of emotional intelligence tends to flow better. You gain appreciation for the challenge of controlling emotional impulses and become more empathetic and patient with others.",emotional intelligence,Developing Your Emotional Intelligence,0.9693898
,Emotional Intelligence: Being Aware of the Emotions of Others,"You cannot achieve results by just focusing on yourself. Work is comprised of groups, teams, relationships, and networks. And organizational dynamics, interpersonal relationships, and the diversity of personality styles will continually challenge your emotional intelligence. Your ability to interact with and influence others, especially when emotions are running high, relies heavily on your personal self–awareness and self–management competence. The more you work on yourself, the better able you are to relate to others. When you are skilled in relationship awareness, your focus is on the other person or persons, while you also manage yourself.",emotional intelligence,Developing Your Emotional Intelligence,0.9370413

,Roadblocks to Excellent Listening,"Before the most advanced listening skills can be deployed, it's critical to remove the common roadblocks to effective listening. There are listening traps that we all fall victim to from time to time, which diminish our effectiveness. Distractions, both internal and external, may keep us from having the most productive conversation if they're not removed or mitigated. Our thoughts and feelings often become roadblocks to effective listening when our biases, our emotional reactions, or our focus on preparing to speak interferes with our effectiveness. Additionally, a listener's own speech can shut down the flow of information. Finally, a roadblock that everyone faces at some point is boredom. Listening to a boring speaker or topic can provide challenges for effectively receiving and retaining critical information. Fortunately, there is hope. We can all learn to listen better despite boredom. In this course, you'll review techniques for overcoming roadblocks to listening.

Psychologists, talk show hosts, or police negotiators may use active listening skills more than any other set of skills. Though you may not be counseling someone in distress, getting a celebrity to reveal their emotions, or bargaining for hostages, the principles of active listening are the same. Active listening means listening attentively to the speaker's words, meaning, intent, and emotions in an unbiased positive way. Active listening also involves creatively utilizing a blend of discrete skills that can be brought to bear in any conversation to draw out additional meaning, intent, and emotions.

,Feedback and Its Vital Role in the Workplace,"
Everyone needs corrective and constructive feedback from time to time, but if you're like many people, the prospect of giving that feedback is chilling.

You’ll also get some tips on how to handle situations where someone reacts badly to your feedback.",feedback,Fundamental Skills,0.99870706
,Receiving Feedback,"
Even well-intended constructive feedback can be difficult to take. There are biological foundations for the feelings that result, and it's easy to see why people often respond negatively.

In this course, you'll learn how to manage your natural reactions, respond productively, and unleash the power of constructive feedback in your own development.",feedback,Fundamental Skills,0.99930465
,Making Feedback a Regular Occurrence,"
Feedback works best as an ongoing effort, not an occasional event. Workplaces that incorporate feedback into daily practice enjoy more communication and fewer unpleasant surprises.

,The Accounting Equation and Financial Statements,"

Business owners and managers, regardless of form and size of their organizations, put their best efforts in generating enough assets to pay for business's liabilities and build adequate stockholders' equity. The basic accounting equation offers us a simple way to understand how these three elements – assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity – relate to each other. Every economic activity, or transaction, in an organization affects two or more of these elements. It is therefore important to understand how these elements, and the underlying transactions, appear in financial statements that provide a summary of a business's performance over a period of time. This course aims at familiarizing learners with the basic accounting equation and financial statements. You are introduced to the accounting equation and how given transactions affect the specific accounts using the debit and credit rule. This course also presents the key characteristics of financial statements and how they are related to each other.

,The Accounting Cycle and Accrual Accounting,"Accounting involves recording, summarizing, and presenting financial transactions. You need to analyze transactions before recording them in daily journals. Organizations use a variety of accounts, called general ledgers collectively, to record transactions in a number of business areas. A chart of accounts lists all these accounts in the general ledger. All individual accounts are then compiled, totaled and verified for correctness, and then presented as financial statements to the organization's internal and external users. As in most other things, timing is of prime importance in accounting, specifically in recording transactions. Most organizations record revenue or expense transactions when they actually take place – known as accrual accounting. Others do it when money actually changes hands – known as cash accounting.  This course teaches the essentials of the accounting cycle, chart of accounts, and accrual accounting method.

Quantitative assessment leads to sound capital allocation based on projected cash flows, while qualitative assessment adds an element of risk management, relying on the experience and knowledge of those familiar with the business. Once capital is allocated and projects are implemented, it's important to continue to monitor the projects' progress. A post-implementation audit is an important follow-up, used to detect any deviations from the forecasted results and to gain experience that can be used in making future capital budgeting decisions.   The course introduces the process of allocating capital based on qualitative assessment factors, and incorporating other qualitative factors – such as the priority of projects – into the allocation of decisions. It also briefly covers project monitoring and post-implementation auditing. ",financial management,,keyword match
,Bank Branch Management: Mortgage and Auto Loans,"Mortgages and auto loans make up the majority of the loans at retail banks. Mortgage loan components include the principal, interest rate, mortgage term, amortization period, and repayment schedule. Individuals applying for mortgage applications are considered for credibility, down payment, and income or expense ratios. With an approved mortgage comes responsibilities for both the borrower or mortgagor, and the lender or mortgagee. Auto loans are similar to mortgages. Assets and liabilities, securities attached to the loan, credibility, the debt-to-income ratio, and the repayment arrangements are key in the loan consideration. These are the two most common loans, and arguably the most valuable to a bank.  This course examines the basic mortgage loan components, the mortgage application criteria, and borrower and lender responsibilities. The course also discusses auto loan components and the loan approval criteria.",management,,keyword match

,Bank Branch Management: Dealing with Operational and Credit Risks,"There are many risks facing banks: home owners defaulting on mortgages, interest changes impacting the value of a bank's loans, human error, and natural disasters, among many others. One of the main categories of risk a bank faces is operational risk. This includes process-related risks, process execution and delivery risks, external and internal fraud risks, damage to asset risks, and business system risks. Another category of risk is credit risk, the likelihood that borrowers might not fulfill their contracts, and the value that could be recovered by the bank if a borrower defaults. The way to reduce or mitigate these risks is to have an effective risk management plan to deal with operational and credit risks.  This course examines the basics of risk management. It covers the causes of operational risk and how to manage it.

,Commodity and Energy Markets and Derivatives,"The commodities and energy markets are generally considered to be some of the largest markets in existence. Every day billions of dollars of commodities such as oil, coal, gold, and sugar are bought and sold between various traders acting on behalf of producers, manufacturers, and financial institutions. The derivatives market has seen explosive growth around these markets over the decades. Although traditionally used by farmers and other manufacturers to protect themselves against price movements that would affect their profitability, derivatives are now widely used by many financial institutions as a way to profit on speculation and arbitrage. Financial institutions, such as banks and hedge funds, are profit seekers by their inherent nature and are willing to take risks in return for these profits. Hedgers, on the other hand, look to protect themselves by removing risk or hedging. These two different points of view complement each other and have allowed the market to grow rapidly and become quite liquid— for every hedger there is almost always a speculator willing to take the opposite side of the trade.  This course covers the fundamental characteristics of the commodities and energy markets. We examine the types of underlying products that are traded, such as various metals and energy producing chemicals, and we also examine what they are used for. We then identify various financial contracts known as derivatives whereby these products may be bought or sold at a predetermined price, in specific quantities, and for delivery at a future date. The course focuses on the features of forward and futures commodity contracts and swap and option commodity contracts and their uses for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.",derivatives,,keyword match
,"Futures Fundamentals: Commodity, Equity, and Currency Futures","Futures contracts have long been used by the agriculture industry to eliminate the price risks associated with farming produce. This elimination of price risks, known as hedging, has become a common practice in today's markets. Trading in futures has moved beyond its agricultural origins and is now a modus operandi for numerous trading parties whose incentives are to either decrease the risk factor by hedging, or to make a profit through speculation. Futures contracts form a significant trading sector in the global financial system. They now trade on various commodities, including energy, single stocks and stock indices, interest rates and currencies, and some more exotic benchmarks such as the climate.  This course examines the fundamentals of futures contracts, including their pricing and quotation, and how they are used by hedgers as a protection against adverse price risks and by speculators as a means to increase profit through calculated risk.

,Interest Rate Futures and Forward Rate Agreements,"Management of interest rates is an important aspect for any financial institution that lends or borrows funds, as well as for those that invest in fixed income instruments and any other company that uses debt to fund its operations. Benchmark interest rates, which are set by economic authorities in various regions of the world, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, can materially affect the bottom line profit of these companies. Interest rate management is an important activity for these companies. Using interest rates related activities, these companies can offset any adverse effects associated with interest rate movements. These products are also used by entities that wish to speculate on the movement of interest rates, essentially taking an educated bet on where interest rates may move to over a period of time, and profiting from such moves.  This course examines the fundamentals of both long-term and short-term interest rate futures and their specifications, as well as their application in hedging and speculation. It also introduces and demonstrates how Forward Rate Agreements may be used by a corporation to lock in a funding rate into the future.",finance,Adobe InDesign CS5,0.91939443

,Mutual Funds: Portfolio Management and Accounting,"Mutual funds have seen phenomenal growth over a number of decades, with no sign of it slowing down in the future. The key benefits to investors are that the funds allow for diversification, professional investment management, and asset liquidity. Equity and bond are the two most traditional types of mutual funds where active and passive investment strategies are employed. Active investment strategies require the investment managers to perform due diligence and apply financial and business acumen to increase the value of funds under management, whereas passive investment strategies focus on replicating an already established index of equities or bonds. An important aspect of mutual funds is accounting, which is centered around the accurate valuation of the fund's assets and the calculation of the Net Asset Value.  The topics in this course cover equity mutual funds and the strategies used for their management such as replication, sampling, growth, and value. Bond mutual funds are introduced and corresponding strategies such as managing the duration and yield curve position are covered. Finally, the course introduces the main accounting functions of mutual funds and how the Net Asset Value is calculated.",portfolio management,,keyword match
,Mutual Funds: Performance Evaluation and Regulations,"Over the past few decades the mutual fund industry has seen extreme swings in performance, resulting in dramatic changes in the value of investors' portfolios. The risk versus return dynamics of a mutual fund must be carefully analyzed by any investor. The investors must consider whether the type of mutual fund they are about to invest in is appropriate for their objectives. In order to do so, the investor should assess the fund's historical return and the amount of risk that the fund has taken to achieve that return, as well as other critical factors. To assess all this information, investors must be able to read and understand the fund prospectus and any other complementary information that is provided by the fund manager and other public sources. The mutual fund industry is a highly regulated industry whereby financial authorities set rules and restrictions to improve transparency of transactions, in an effort to ensure the safety of investors' money.  This course introduces a number of performance metrics such as Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Alpha, Standard Deviation, Beta, and R-squared, which are used to determine the risk and return characteristics of a mutual fund.

,Banking Supervision and Corporate Governance,"With the rapid growth of the banking industry in the early 21st century, it became clear that increased banking supervision was required. This increased supervision was also necessary to ensure that the global financial framework would remain intact even at times of great market turmoil and bank failures. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is considered to be the global banking industry standard setter, has created a number of core principles which it believes will lead to good corporate governance and best practices in the banking sector.  This course examines the core principles and the self-assessment methodologies set forth by the Basel Committee.

These best practices ensure that stakeholders can put their trust in the financial system. The banking crisis and rapid growth of the banking industry at the beginning of the 21st century created the need for banks to develop strong internal controls and establish good corporate governance. Banks must be audited, both internally and externally, to assess the state of internal controls and corporate governance and address any identified weaknesses.

,Anti-money Laundering and Global Initiatives,"Money laundering is an illegal process of using legitimate means to conceal the true source of funds that are acquired through illegal activities, including drug trafficking and terrorism. This activity has grown and become more sophisticated as it keeps pace with modern technology, leaving authorities world-wide with the difficult task of trying to stay one step ahead of the criminals. Various unreliable estimates have been produced to measure this practice globally, with some estimates quoting sums as large as percentage points of the global economy. Because of this, countries across the world have created joint programs to combat and prevent money laundering.  This course introduces the concept of money laundering and identifies the different types, enabling circumstances and common indicators for this activity. It also acknowledges global initiatives such as the Financial Action Task Force, the Basel Committee, and the International Money Laundering Information Network, among others, that set recommended actions to prevent and combat money laundering.

,Basel Regulations and Capital Adequacy Requirements,"Banks are required to maintain an adequate capital level at all times to protect depositors and creditors, including other banks, from exposure to risk. A set of international banking regulations, known as Basel I, was introduced in 1988. This accord recommended a minimum capital requirement of 8% of risk-weighted assets for banks operating internationally. The way in which the adequate capital requirement for banks is calculated has changed dramatically since then. Following a series of revisions and impact analyses, implementation of a new set of regulations, Basel II, began in 2007. Basel II aimed to strengthen the stability of the international banking system through capital requirements that were aligned closely to the underlying credit, market, and operational risks. Basel III began implementation in 2013 and lays down stricter capital standards, additional capital buffers, and higher risk-weighted assets and minimum capital ratio requirements.  This course provides an overview of the main features of the Basel regulations relating to capital adequacy requirements. It discusses various elements of Basel I, including the approach for determining capital adequacy and on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items and associated risks. The course then identifies factors that led to the development of the Basel II and Basel III standards.

,Basel II and Basel III: An Overview,"Developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the latest Basel regulations – Basel II and Basel III – represent decades of comprehensive global banking reforms. The aim of Basel II and Basel III is to strengthen the stability of the international banking system. Basel II is based on three mutually reinforcing pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review process, as well as market discipline and disclosure requirements. Its key goal is to determine the minimum level of capital banks need to maintain to cover the risks they're exposed to in their lending and investment activities. Considered a major overhaul of Basel II, Basel III requires stronger capital and liquidity standards to be accompanied by better risk management and supervision by banks. Basel III endeavors to plug any gaps that were present in Basel II and also attempts to strengthen the regulations promoted by Basel II.  This course gives an overview of Basel II and Basel III; the factors that led to the two accords, objectives, key approaches, and differences between them. It focuses on how various Basel regulations help banks become stronger and better managers of their risks.

,IRB Framework and Risk-rating System,"When banks and other financial institutions offer loans, leases, and other credit related services, counterparty credit risk is arguably the most significant risk that they face. The Basel regulations, specifically Basel II and III, stress the need for a strong risk measurement and supervision framework and recommend banks follow one of two approaches. The first approach, called the standard approach, requires banks to use ratings from external credit rating agencies to determine minimum capital required to cover their credit exposures. In contrast to this simplistic approach, the second approach, called internal-ratings based (IRB) approach, relies on internal risk rating systems developed by the banks themselves. Banks are required to categorize their risk exposures in categories such as corporate, sovereign, bank, retail, and equity. The estimation of key risk components or parameters such as probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default, and maturity is also required.   This course presents a high level view of IRB approaches, rating systems, and related concepts. The course covers the foundation IRB and advanced IRB approaches, and discusses related concepts such as banking-book exposures and risk components. The course also goes on to discuss key components of an IRB system and the rating system design for a bank. ",,Agile Project Management Fundamentals (PMI_ACP Certification aligned),Score < threshold
,IRB Approach for Corporate and Retail Exposures,"One of the key goals of the Basel framework is to ensure that banks maintain a minimum level of capital at all times in order to cover their credit risk. Basel regulations propose a number of approaches for determining credit risk capital. Basel II, for instance, proposes an advanced and sophisticated approach called the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach for determining capital requirements for credit risk. This approach relies heavily upon a bank's internal assessment of its counterparties and is subject to strict data, validation, and operational requirements. The IRB approach deals with various types of banking-book exposures, such as corporate and retail credits and borrowers, differently because of their unique underlying risk characteristics.  This course presents a high-level overview of the IRB approach for determining retail and corporate credit risk. Apart from providing an overview of Basel, and especially the IRB approach, it also discusses the IRB framework for retail and corporate exposures. The course also discusses risk weights and minimum requirements for these two types of exposures.",retail,Agile Project Management Fundamentals (PMI_ACP Certification aligned),0.9688789
,Quantification of IRB Systems,"Basel II proposed a sophisticated approach for determining capital requirements for credit risk, known as the internal ratings-based approach (IRB). The IRB approach is predicated upon a bank's internal assessment of its credit risk and is subject to strict data, validation, and operational requirements. When using the IRB approach, a bank also has to put a system in place that consists of four interdependent components: credit risk rating, quantification of risk ratings, data maintenance, and oversight mechanisms. Taken as a whole, these components present a framework for defining and improving the evaluation of credit risk. The quantification component in this framework helps translate credit risk ratings against the IRB risk parameters, which are probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), and maturity (M).

,Data Maintenance and Oversight for IRB Systems,"Banks that adopt the IRB approach to determine regulatory capital rely on their internal systems for assessment of credit risk. In order to produce reliable risk estimates, these IRB systems are subject to strict validation and data management practices. The two most significant of these practices are data maintenance and control and oversight. Effective IRB data maintenance encompasses sufficient checks and balances during collection, storage, retrieval, and analysis of essential data for obligors and facilities throughout the entire data life cycle. A control and oversight mechanism ensures that the various components of the IRB system are functioning properly.  This course introduces various aspects of data maintenance, control, and oversight mechanisms for IRB systems. It illustrates the life cycle tracking for data and discusses the role of data in the IRB system. The course also outlines various Basel guidelines for ensuring data quality and integrity, and independence, transparency, reviews, audits, and corporate oversight of IRB systems.",maintenance,Agile Project Management Fundamentals (PMI_ACP Certification aligned),0.92731917
,Basel Regulations and Operational Risk Management,"Operational risk is a significant risk that banks and other financial institutions face. Basel regulations, specifically Basel II, have established principles and guidelines for holding adequate capital to cover losses that arise from operational risk events. There are two broad categories of operational risk activities: measurement and management. Operational risk measurement involves quantitative assessment of operational risk and is used for determining regulatory capital. On the other hand, operational risk management involves a qualitative assessment of operational risk and a system to manage that. A successful operational risk program under Basel II combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to ensure operational risk is effectively measured and managed.  This course discusses various aspects of operational risk management and measurement as outlined in Basel II regulations. It identifies key operational risk events and sources, and common risk measurement methods. It then introduces aspects of the operational risk management framework and Basel II principles for managing operational risk in banks. These principles deal with developing an operational risk management environment, as well as the governance, continuity, and disclosure of operational risk in banks.",risk management,,keyword match
,Operational Risk and Advanced Measurement Approach,"Basel regulations, specifically Basel II, establish principles and guidelines for banks to calculate their minimum capital requirements for credit, market, and operational risk. Operational risk represents the risk of financial loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. Depending on the level of sophistication of individual banks, Basel II permits three methods for calculating operational risk capital charges: basic indicator approach, standardized approach, and advanced measurement approach (AMA). The AMA is the most sophisticated and risk sensitive of the three and allows banks to use their own method for assessing their exposure to operational risk provided they meet certain requirements set by Basel. A bank's AMA would be obliged to make use of certain data elements, primarily taking into account internal loss, business environment, and internal control factors to create a reliable estimate of the operational risk capital charge. Banks should also have systems for regular validation and verification and should ensure successful development, implementation, and maintenance of the AMA framework.  This course presents a high-level view of the advanced measurement approach and Basel regulations for its successful deployment in banks. It recognizes types of AMAs and characteristics of AMA data elements. It then explains validation and verification as part of operational risk management framework and identifies key components of operational loss event valuation.",risk management,,keyword match
,"Operational Risk Identification, Assessment, and Quantification","The Basel Committee identifies operational risk as the key risk that banks face on account of inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or external events. The Committee requires that banks hold adequate capital to cover these potential losses. Banks use a number of methods and tools to identify, assess, quantify, and respond to potential operational risk events. These may include building and using a loss event database, identifying key risk indicators (KRIs), and using tools such as risk and control self-assessment (RCSA), scenarios, and scorecards. The analysis of historic losses also provides meaningful information for assessing the bank's exposure to operational risk and for developing a strategy for their mitigation and control.  This course introduces identification, assessment, and quantification of operational risk in a bank or a financial institution including key decisions affecting the determination of internal loss database, the KRI framework, steps in the RCSA process, and operational risk quantification.",risk management,,keyword match
,"Operational Risk Management Framework, Process, and Applications","Basel regulations include established principles and guidelines for managing operational risks and holding adequate capital to cover potential losses from operational risk events. The Basel Committee requires a bank or a financial institution to have an adequate operational risk management framework for this purpose. As a result, an operational risk management (ORM) framework and corresponding ORM processes should comprise important steps such as identification, assessment, reporting, monitoring and control, and mitigation of operational risk. The ORM efforts at a bank yield several management applications aimed at business goals such as risk awareness, loss reduction, and risk optimization and mitigation.  This course discusses various aspects of operational risk management framework, process and applications in banks. It identifies key risk events, characteristics of an operational risk management framework, and steps in an ORM process. The course then discusses key management applications of ORM efforts, challenges, and components of ORM deployment strategy.",risk management,,keyword match
,Management and Supervision of Liquidity Risk,"During the credit crisis of 2007, many of the problems were not a result of shortage of capital, but of enormous liquidity risk taken by banks. When the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision introduced the third Basel Accord, or Basel III, in December 2010, it required banks to have stronger liquidity standards as well as better risk management and supervision. As a result, Basel III introduced several liquidity risk measurement, management, and supervision tools and guidelines for banks, including two liquidity ratios to provide supervisors with important information required to assess the liquidity risk of a bank and to ensure that banks survive liquidity pressures. Basel III also introduced several principles that banks should follow for efficient management and supervision of their liquidity risk.  This course discusses liquidity, liquidity risk, and its management. It introduces the two key liquidity risk ratios - the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio. The course then introduces various principles for governance, public disclosure, supervision, measurement, and management of liquidity risk at banks.",management,,keyword match
," Liquidity Risk Measurement, Monitoring, and Application of Standards","Liquidity of a bank describes its ability to meet out its debt obligations as and when they arise without incurring unacceptably large losses. A sound liquidity risk management framework comprises an array of metrics, measurement, and monitoring tools to assist supervisors in identifying and analyzing liquidity risks. Basel III introduced several liquidity risk standards, including two liquidity ratios to assess the liquidity risk and to ensure that banks survive liquidity pressures. Basel III also introduced a set of monitoring tools aimed at capturing specific information related to a bank's cash flows, balance sheet structure, available unencumbered collateral and certain market indicators.  This course presents a high-level view of common liquidity risk ratios, measurement and monitoring of liquidity risk, and application of liquidity risk management tools. It discusses key liquidity risk standards and tools for measuring and monitoring liquidity risk in banks.

,"Derivative Contracts: Futures, Forwards, Swaps, and Options","A derivative contract, or derivative for short, is a bilateral contract that derives its value from an underlying security – a stock, bond, or a commodity – and is used for managing risks associated with these securities. Derivatives have seen a phenomenal growth over the past few decades. Traditionally, they are used for protecting banks, financial institutions, and traders from adverse movements in the price of financial instruments and commodities. In other words, derivatives are generally used for hedging purposes. However, more recently they have also been used by sophisticated investors to speculate on price movements of reference assets or to employ strategies for riskless profit, called arbitrage.   In this course we examine some generally used categories of derivatives – futures, forwards, swaps, and options, and their applications. We examine pricing, margin requirements, mark-to-market, and cash flow calculations along with important considerations and characteristics of these products.",,Thinking Critically,Score < threshold
,Measuring Credit Risk of Derivative Contracts,"The size of the global derivatives market has by some estimates reached a notional value of a quadrillion dollars. Among the primary users of derivatives are commodity-based corporations, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, and private investors. The credit worthiness of different parties to these contracts has been under focus since the credit crisis of 2008, which led to many institutions going bankrupt due to a lack of focus on credit risk. Credit risk has emerged as the major risk in dealing with derivative contracts. In order for derivatives users to manage the associated credit risk, they must develop models and procedures required to measure credit risk in monetary terms.  This course identifies the sources of credit risk in widely used derivatives, with a distinction made between over-the-counter versus market traded derivatives. The course also introduces the credit equivalent risk framework, which utilizes statistical techniques to determine a risk factor that is used as an input to determine potential credit loss. In determining potential credit loss, the course also considers the probability of default and recovery rates determined through a credit rating process, analysts' judgements, and other information sources.",credit risk,,keyword match
,Mitigating Credit Risk,"Over the past decade, credit risk has become a main focus for many financial institutions, most notably banks. Credit risk occurs when there is a possibility of a borrower or counterparty to a transaction being unable or unwilling to perform their financial obligations. Utilizing credit risk mitigation techniques, financial institutions are able to minimize what could otherwise be substantial losses when the credit markets or particular borrowers are under pressure. The losses may sometimes be large enough to render a company insolvent and put it out of business. Mitigating the loss due to credit risk ensures that if conditions deteriorate, the financial institution will be able to recover quickly or even remain unaffected.  This course introduces two main sources of credit risk: pre-settlement risk and settlement risk. It also investigates various methods for mitigating credit risk, such as netting, margins, collateral, and hedging.",credit risk,,keyword match
,Credit Rating Systems and Capital Reserves,"When dealing with other parties, banks and other financial institutions face a variety of risks. The most relevant of these is credit risk. The global expansion of sophisticated products, such as derivatives and a host of other products, has further fueled the rise in transaction values. This poses a real threat to a company's well-being, regardless of its size. Emerging from the credit crisis of 2007, which saw a number of financial institutions, both large and small, fail due to unmanageable credit losses, it has become paramount for organizations to track and manage credit risk. In addition, new global banking rules are in place to guide various financial institutions towards best practices for credit risk management. Under current international banking regulations, credit ratings of counterparties have become ever more important in determining how much capital reserves financial institutions should set aside to protect themselves from potential counterparty defaults.  This course focuses on external credit rating agencies and the process by which credit ratings are determined. It discusses how credit ratings are used to calculate credit risk, which in turn allows the banks and financial institution to determine how much capital they need to cover their risk. The course also discusses the use of an internal credit rating process to determine capital reserves.",credit,Thinking Critically,0.8841759
,Credit Analysis and Loan Pricing and Regulations,The credit crisis of the early 21st century has been a stark reminder to financial organizations of the inherent risks involved in extending large amounts of credit. Banks have revisited their credit procedures and have a renewed emphasis on credit analysis and pricing loans correctly to reflect the associated credit risks. A robust credit risk analysis process will ensure that banks can better judge the amount of credit risk that they are willing to undertake and what kind of measures they should take to protect themselves from such risks. It is also important for banks to understand lending regulations that are set up to protect them from holding illiquid assets and becoming insolvent.  This course introduces the basics of credit analysis and the general process for conducting it. It then discusses the components of loan pricing and describes how banks' lending policies are regulated by the banking authorities.,regulatory,,keyword match
,Financial Analysis for Credit Risk Determination,"Making credit decisions requires both quantitative and qualitative analysis. A diligent credit analysis coupled with strong credit policies will typically reduce a financial company's credit risk. Quantitative analysis includes financial statement analysis (FSA). Banks and other financial institutions use FSA techniques frequently in performing their credit decisions. FSA is used to determine the financial state of a company and how it compares to its peers. It consists of techniques that include financial ratios and cash flow analysis. Key financial ratios are used to assess the company's profitability, ability to pay back interest and debt, and the levels of leverage that the company deploys. In the context of credit, the cash flow analysis provides information on whether the company can generate enough funds to increase their debt load.  This course gives a brief overview of the structure of a company's financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The course introduces financial statement analysis and some of its components, such as ratio analysis and cash flow analysis. Ratio analysis includes financial ratios that are indicative of the company's liquidity, solvency, profitability, and efficiency, and how these ratios are analyzed both historically and also compared to the company's peers.  The course also covers two different methods of calculating the company's free cash flows, an important indicator determining whether the company can add to its debt load.",financial management,,keyword match
,Nonfinancial Credit and Asset Analysis,"Making credit decisions requires proficiency in both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Qualitative analysis is a nonfinancial credit analysis that complements the quantitative analysis and is regularly used by banks and other financial institutions that lend money to businesses. In addition to other information about the entity, the analysis also reveals important information such as whether the business being analyzed has competent management and whether it is likely to produce enough cash flow to service any credit that may be extended. After credit decisions have been made, credit analysts must constantly monitor the quality of the loan portfolio to ensure that the bank does not take on any unnecessary risk. This involves ranking loans according to their quality, as well as ensuring that enough cash reserves are put aside to protect the bank from possible defaults.  This course introduces nonfinancial credit analysis and includes the Five Cs used to assess credit risk, as well as Porter's Five Forces that assess the competitiveness of a business. It then looks at a framework for evaluating the management of the business to determine its competence in performing its duties. Finally, the course briefly examines the process for analyzing asset quality in a bank's lending portfolio and classifying assets according to their level of credit risk.",credit,Adobe Reader X,0.92495733
,Problem Loans and Risk Analysis for Common Loans,"Problem loans affect the bottom line profitability of banks. Therefore, it is vital to identify these loans and determine the reasons why they occur. Warning signs typically exist that may inform loan portfolio administrators of impending issues with consumer or business loans. When loans do become problematic, there are certain measures that banks can take to protect themselves, such as restructuring debt, liquidating, or securing assets. Such techniques were widely used during the global credit crisis of the early 21st century, and continue to be relevant in a contemporary credit risk management setting. It is important for analysts to understand the different kinds of consumer loans and tools such as credit scorecards that assist in determining the credit risk level of borrowers.  This course introduces non-performing loans and gives an overview of their warning signs. It also describes ways that banks can protect themselves from non-performing loans and minimize any associated losses. It then identifies types of consumer loans and how consumer credit scorecards are used to distinguish high risk borrowers from low risk ones.  ",loans,Adobe Reader X,0.7901462
,Risk Analysis for Specialized Loans,"Asset-based loans, such as accounts receivable loans and inventory-based loans are ways for companies to free up cash flow that can be used for funding other working capital requirements. These specialized loans, in which a company's noncash assets that are expected to be converted to cash sometime in the future – such as accounts receivable and inventory – are converted into cash by a bank. This type of lending is generally used when lending from other places in the market is difficult or impossible. Another form of lending is participation lending, which allows many banks to control their credit risk by contributing smaller amounts to a larger loan. In case of a default, the funds at risk are much smaller than if one bank took the whole loan upon itself.  This course introduces accounts receivable and inventory-based loans and the ways to analyze risks associated with these. It then briefly investigates participation loans and focuses on critical points that an analyst must consider when dealing with participation loans.",financial management,,keyword match
,Credit Derivatives and Credit Risk,"Credit derivatives have gained increased attention over the past decade primarily due to the need for major financial institutions to transfer credit risk off their books. These financial contracts are also widely used by speculators to profit from potential credit events. It has become imperative for major financial institutions to recognize the need to measure credit risk using traditional and contemporary models. Credit risk measurements allow the financial institutions to determine what type of credit derivatives to use and how to price them. It is important for analysts to distinguish between the different types of credit derivatives such as Credit Default Swaps, Total Return Swaps, Credit Linked Notes, Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations, and others. In addition to this, analysts must have a good understanding of the types of credit risk models that exist.  This course gives an overview of credit risk and how credit derivatives assist in transferring credit risk to other parties. It briefly covers major types of credit derivatives including credit default swaps, total return swaps, spread and bond options, credit-linked notes, principal-protected structures, repackaging vehicles, and synthetic CDOs.

,Classical Credit Derivatives and Total Return Swaps,"Credit derivatives have seen immense growth over the past decade. They are used by hedgers to protect against credit risk and by speculators to take on credit exposure in the hope of earning high returns. Credit derivatives are also used by other financial institutions, such as banks, as a means of funding. Credit derivatives typically reference fixed income securities as a contract's underlying asset because of the inherent credit risk that arises from fixed income security ownership. Total return swaps have emerged as one of the most commonly known, and used, types of credit derivative due to their versatility and effectiveness in transferring credit risk from one entity to another.  This course introduces some classic credit derivatives, such as asset swaps, basket and portfolio swaps, and principal protected notes, and also focuses on total return swaps and their applications. The course commences with an overview of debt instrument basics, which provides the basis for understanding its association with credit derivatives.",credit derivatives,,keyword match
,Securitization and Asset-backed Securities,"Securitization has become one of the leading tools used by banks and other financial institutions to manage their balance sheet by transferring assets off the balance sheet – typically loans. The securitization process and the products involved are highly complex financial tools and transactions, which can limit investors' ability to monitor and manage risk. Securitization became a widespread practice in the 1970s, although examples of it can be found much earlier. It has experienced immense growth globally, by some estimates to around $13 trillion. Securitizations involving mortgages and other assets, such as credit card receivables, housing and auto loans, airline receivables, and student loans, have become common place. Securitization brings many advantages to the issuer in the form of lower funding costs, reduction in asset and liability mismatching, as well as lower capital requirements and transfer of credit risk.   This course introduces the concept of securitization and important aspects relating to it, such as the role of a special purpose vehicle and note tranching. It examines mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the major risks faced by investors. Different asset-backed security (ABS) structures, which include securities backed by credit card receivables, home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans, are presented at a high level. Then, the course presents the structure of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that include collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) and collateralized loan obligations (CLO), as well as how regular CDOs and Synthetic CDOs are used for arbitrage and balance sheet transactions.",derivatives,Adobe AIR 3,0.85374
,Credit-linked and Repackaged Notes,"The structured derivatives market gained traction in the early 2000's due to its ability to convert security features, primarily cash flows and maturity, to meet investors' specific needs. This market is composed of complicated combinations of securities and derivatives, allowing for a large degree of flexibility to cater to investor demands. Because potential risks have also become increasingly complicated to identify and measure, it is important for individuals involved in these structured deals to have a good grasp of the dynamics of various transactions and how they may be altered when packaged with others.  This course provides an introduction to the basics of credit-linked notes (CLN) and their variations and structures, including total return swap-based CLNs and default-based CLNs. The course also provides an overview of repackaged notes and other synthetic structures dealing with the packaging of derivatives with assets such as synthetic bonds, and callable and puttable asset swaps.",derivatives,Adobe AIR 3,0.9348373
,Credit Default Swaps and Credit Spread Options,"Credit Default Swaps have emerged as the most widely used credit derivatives in the financial markets. They provide banks and other financial institutions with the means to transfer credit risk off their books and to diversify their financial portfolios. These products are also extensively used for additional yield generation through the receipt of premiums, as well as to speculate on credit spread curve fluctuations. Options on credit default swaps, known as swaptions, have become popular as an extension of swaps, which provide channels for credit spread strategies to hedge and speculate credit risk. The use of credit spread options and credit spread futures has increased the demand for credit derivatives. They are most frequently used by international banks and investment houses to manage and profit from credit events.  This course provides an overview of credit default swaps, swaptions, and constant maturity credit default swaps, and also covers how they work and their typical payoff profiles. It then introduces the two categories of credit spread options: those that reference obligations with fixed credit spreads and those that reference the level of credit spread on the reference obligation. Credit spread forwards contracts are also briefly covered.",credit,Adobe AIR 3,0.94442576
,Credit Derivatives Applications,"The ongoing rapid growth of credit derivatives, which began in the late 1900s, has primarily been fueled by the requirements of large international banks to manage their regulatory capital requirements and increase the efficiency of their capital reserves. This has led to a wider acceptance of these instruments, mainly as a means to remove credit risk off the books of one entity and onto the books of another who is willing to accept it. In addition to large international banks, many smaller regional banks and insurance and reinsurance providers, as well as institutional investors, hedge funds, and corporations, have become the users of credit derivatives.

,Credit Derivatives: Pricing and Operational Issues,"Credit derivatives were introduced in the early 1990s and have been widely adopted as a means for transferring credit risk exposure from one market participant to another. Before this time, these products were primarily used by banks to reduce the credit risk inherent in their loan portfolios. Credit derivatives have since evolved to include an array of different structured products that can be greatly tailored to the user's specific needs, and are used by a variety of entities wishing to hedge, speculate, or profit from arbitrage. By 2005, the growth of credit derivatives outgrew the processing capabilities of firms offering these products, both in terms of technology and people. These products are highly complex to price, and human errors and system failures can lead to enormous financial losses.  This course introduces the general risks generated by credit derivatives, including credit risks, default risks, modeling, and legal risks. It briefly covers some pricing techniques for several widely used credit derivatives, including credit default swaps, asset swaps, and bond options.

,"Credit Derivatives: Regulatory, Legal, and Taxation Issues","Credit derivatives are highly complex financial instruments used to transfer credit risk from one entity to another. These instruments are defined as contracts that are traded over-the-counter between private parties. Due to their private nature, the inherent risks posed by such agreements have forced regulators to address legal, accounting, and tax issues related to these agreements. Standardized documentation and definitions have been created to allow for mutual understanding between the two parties and try to remove any vagueness in the contract details that may prove detrimental to either party. Standardization will never be complete for such agreements due to the specific requirements of different users from one contract to another; however, they hope to build on a mutual solid foundation while still allowing flexibility to meet end user requirements. Because proper accounting and taxation treatment of these products is constantly evolving, professional judgment plays a great role in these areas.  This course introduces regulatory documentation set out by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and the legal issues that may arise due to a lack of proper documentation and understanding between two parties. It also examines the issue surrounding the definition of restructuring as a credit event. The course briefly covers regulatory issues, including centralized clearing mechanisms and collateral margins, and the accounting treatment and tax issues regarding credit derivatives.",credit derivatives,,keyword match

,Selling Creativity Short with Peter Field,"We have been exposed to a thought provoking study from Peter Field on the effects of creativity on business results. The presentation starts by examining the nature of the link between creativity and effectiveness over the last 20 years and the scale of business success that creativity has brought. It goes on to observe and explain how short-termism is undermining effectiveness in general and in particular the value of creativity.

Short termism is running campaigns/executions for less than 6 months.  These short term campaigns include a mix of new product launches, seasonal events, promotional campaigns, some hybrid sales activation and brand-building idea campaigns. The common features are a focus on short-term sales driving with little or no on-going activity beyond the ‘quick burst’ to embed changes in brand perceptions or purchasing behaviour and a tendency to focus on product information at the expense of emotional brand equity.

No process in IT service delivery is foolproof; at some point in time an unplanned interruption will most likely occur ranging from a minor incident to the disastrous crashing of a critical system.

	The habitual and predictable nature of buyer behaviour and the implications of this for the memories consumers hold about brands
	Conversion versus nudging to grow the brand

,Selling Creativity Short with Peter Field eLearning,"We have been exposed to a thought provoking study from Peter Field on the effects of creativity on business results. The presentation starts by examining the nature of the link between creativity and effectiveness over the last 20 years and the scale of business success that creativity has brought. It goes on to observe and explain how short-termism is undermining effectiveness in general and in particular the value of creativity.

Short termism is running campaigns/executions for less than 6 months. These short term campaigns include a mix of new product launches, seasonal events, promotional campaigns, some hybrid sales activation and brand-building idea campaigns. The common features are a focus on short-term sales driving with little or no on-going activity beyond the ‘quick burst’ to embed changes in brand perceptions or purchasing behaviour and a tendency to focus on product information at the expense of emotional brand equity.

Understanding this context is critical to good planning and good decision-making as the project progresses toward achieving its objectives. This course provides an overview of the project management discipline as outlined in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) - Fifth Edition published by the Project Management Institute (PMI®). Specifically, it introduces the characteristics of a project, the responsibilities that accompany project management, and the differences between portfolios, programs, and projects. The course will identify key project management concepts and terms and provide information about the variables that can influence project outcomes. It will also cover the project stakeholders and the organizational influences on a project. This course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up–to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work in their own organizations. This course will assist in preparing the learner for the PMI® certification exam. This course is aligned with the PMBOK® Guide - Fifth Edition, published by PMI®, Inc., 2013.

,Project Fundamentals (PMBOK® Guide Fifth Edition),"

Every project is different. Some are small and straightforward. Others are large and complex. Most are somewhere in the middle. Even though every project is unique, they all have certain attributes in common. Every project has a similar life cycle, starting with an idea, progressing through development, and culminating in the delivery of a finished product or service. A product has a life cycle of its own which is tied into – yet distinct from – the life cycle of the project. All projects have similar overall phases, such as the start-up phase, the planning and design phase, the production phase, and the closing phase. That is all straightforward, but how do a project's phases relate to the stages of its life cycle? Do the natural phases of a project affect the way it is managed? And what types of project management processes should be applied to the specific phases? These are all fundamental questions project managers ask. This course answers these questions and more. It is designed to give project managers and project team members a solid understanding about the nature of projects, how they are structured, and how the structures affect the way they are managed. Specifically, it introduces the concepts of project life cycle, product life cycle, project phases, and project management Process Groups. It provides an in-depth look at how the project management phases interact with each other and with the elements of the project life cycle. The course illustrates these concepts through many examples of small and large projects. Learners will also be introduced to the fundamental source of information for project management professionals: the Project Management Institute (PMI®) and A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fifth Edition published by PMI®. The course will identify key project management concepts and terms, explore the PMBOK® Guide, and the project management Knowledge Areas. This course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

,The Process Groups (PMBOK® Guide Fifth Edition),"
Processes: a set of interrelated actions and activities performed to achieve a specified set of products, results, or services. Good processes, meaning those based on sound principles and proven practices, are a project manager's best friends. Following a set of established processes minimizes confusion and uncertainty for the project manager and all project stakeholders. It ensures the effective progress of the project from initiation through to close-out. In this course, learners will be given an overview of the project management Process Groups as defined in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®) Guide – Fifth Edition published by the Project Management Institute (PMI®). Specifically, learners will be introduced to the following project management Process Groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Learners will also discover how the Process Groups interact with the ten Knowledge Areas: Project Integration Management, Project Scope Management, Project Time Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality Management, Project Human Resource Management, Project Communications Management, Project Risk Management, Project Stakeholder Management, and Project Procurement Management.

,Managing Change: Building Positive Support for Change,"It's often said that people don't like change. But when it comes to organizational change, employees are genuinely interested in making things better – an improvement in processes, systems, functions, or services most likely translates into direct improvements for the employee too. But employees cannot support change and recognize its benefits without first understanding how it impacts their tasks, processes, or roles. Employees – and people in general – empowered with knowledge, understanding, and a clear vision of the future state will not only welcome change, but embrace it.  In this course, you'll learn about the importance of building a motivating atmosphere that supports organizational change, and the importance of creating short-term wins and vision. The course highlights techniques for listening to your employees during change initiatives such as encouraging open communication, listening to employees' feelings, checking for understanding, and taking employee input into consideration. The course also covers actions you can take to support individuals through change initiatives, including coaching for change, making sure employees are empowered with the critical knowledge and skills necessary, considering individual characteristics of your employees, and being flexible.

,Managing Change: Dealing with Resistance to Change,"Change is inevitable in an organization, but the process of adapting can be painful. Organizational change can cause anxiety and upheaval, and when it does, it's no surprise that employees show resistance. Resistance behaviors can vary from individual to individual and they are often unproductive. While managers may be tempted to deal with behaviors directly, rather than tackling symptoms of resistance to change, managers must deal with the source of those symptoms. They must first understand the mixture of emotions and thoughts that come with change, identify the underlying causes of employee resistance, and then use techniques to address those root causes. When the root causes are addressed, behaviors that show resistance to change will fade.   This course outlines these aspects of overcoming resistance to change. It surveys the active and passive symptoms of resistance to change, goes deeper to explore the emotional and thought-based causes of these symptoms, and provides strategies for dealing with root causes through direct conversations with employees.

How can investment of time and money into such a program improve your organization?

,Using Voice of the Customer in Six Sigma,"Customers are at the heart of all Six Sigma initiatives, and this focus on customers is what makes Six Sigma an outstanding organizational performance improvement program. The voice of the customer (VOC) is a Six Sigma strategy used to capture requirements and feedback from the customer and to meet their requirements. Voice of the customer is a critical input at every stage of the Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) process, particularly at the Define stage. At this stage, critical customer requirements are collected, measured, and translated into actionable goals using a number of tools. Using VOC begins with defining Six Sigma goals for collecting and analyzing customer requirements. For this, the Six Sigma team must identify various customer segments – especially the ones most concerned with the project. Then the team needs to identify and select the most effective methods for collecting customer feedback and requirements. From there, customer requirements are translated into measurable, actionable project goals.  This course examines how an organization uses the voice of the customer to define the problem at hand and to set the direction of its Six Sigma efforts.

How well an employee meets requirements set by the boss determines whether that employee succeeds or fails, receives rewards or penalties, and earns praise or criticism. On another level however, the judgment of an external boss isn't enough to make a job personally fulfilling and rewarding. That's something all employees of an organization decide for themselves. Everyone who works must also answer to an inner boss, a personal, internal voice that provides guidance on whether a job is worth doing and whether it is done well.

,Being at my Best: Personal Resourcefulness - In and Out of the Box,"Sometimes we know we are ‘in flow’, at our very best, most resourceful and creative. But what is this state – and how do we reach it more often? When we are out of the box we are at our best and when we are in the box we are not at our best. Whether we are in or out affects how we experience life, how we respond to change and our ability to inspire others.

While it is human and normal to go into the box, and you can’t stop yourself from doing it, you can, however, impact how long you stay in and how quickly you get out. The first step to getting out of the box is recognizing that you’re in. Once you recognize you’re in the box, you can take steps to get out of the box and regain your ability to be at your best.

This module explores these concepts and invites you to reflect on when you are in and out of the box.

,Coaching Techniques that Drive Change,"
Coaching by definition is action-centered. This is the main thing that differentiates it from counseling. At this point in the coaching engagement, the coach and coachee will have agreed on and co-created the Strategic Action Plan, which defines the goals and activities that the coachee will be working on throughout the remainder of the experience.Techniques covered in this course will give the learner the tools needed to lead from behind as a coach. Leading from behind is providing guidance through skillful observation and communication techniques that help guide the coachee's discoveries, self-awareness, epiphanies, and 'aha' moments. Keeping the momentum of progress, staying the course, and creating detours characterize the coach's work in this phase. These are accomplished through coaching tactics that include questioning, listening, observing, and challenging.",soft skills,Coaching & Mentoring,0.64312524
,Coaching to Drive Performance,"
The proven fact is that desired results are achieved more quickly with the guidance of a personal Coach. When a coach is working to drive performance, the coachee is being held accountable to do what they say they are going to do, and want to do. This phase of a coaching engagement is called the 'accountability phase' in coaching. It is also the phase when the 'shoulds and ought-tos' bubble to the surface - the things that a Coachee is unconsciously following, instead of their true aspirations. These 'shoulds and ought-tos come from outside the coachee, and it is in this phase that they must be dealt with, by either eliminating them or figuring out a way to deal with them. Towards the end of this phase, the coachee is clicking along and it's time to 'fire' their coach. The coach is no longer needed as the goals of the engagement are creating the coachee's desired outcome. The coach must be able to spot the pending conclusion of the engagement and set the coachee up for sustainability of performance using coaching tactics.",,Leadership & Management,Score < threshold

,Daten verschieben und Arbeitsblätter ändern in Excel 2010,"
Die problemlose Bearbeitung von Daten stellt den vermutlich größten Nutzen einer Produktivitätsanwendung, wie Excel 2010, dar. Müssen Sie beispielsweise dieselben Daten mehrere Male kopieren oder große Datenmengen innerhalb eines Arbeitsblattes oder zwischen verschiedenen Arbeitsmappen verschieben, so werden Sie bemerken, dass dies mithilfe einer Software wesentlich einfacher ist als mit Stift und Papier. Excel 2010 bietet z. B. Funktionen, wie die Livevorschau, die Ihnen vor dem tatsächlichen Kopieren zeigt, wie die kopierten Daten aussehen werden, auch wenn Sie diese zwischen verschiedenen Office-Anwendungen kopieren möchten, und die Option Inhalte Einfügen, mit deren Hilfe Sie genauer festlegen können, wie Ihre Daten kopiert oder verschoben werden. Dieser Kurs soll viele der Möglichkeiten vorstellen, die Excel 2010 Ihnen bietet, um Daten und die dazugehörigen Arbeitsblätter zu bearbeiten, und beschreibt die Funktionen, die Ihnen dies rasch und effizient ermöglichen.

,Moving Data and Modifying Worksheets in Excel 2010,"

The ability to easily manipulate data is probably the biggest benefit of using productivity applications, such as Excel 2010. For instance, if you have to copy the same data multiple times or move large amounts of data from one place to another within a worksheet or between workbooks, you can see this is much more easily accomplished through software than through the use of pen and paper. For example, Excel 2010 features such as Live Preview let you see how copied data will look before you copy it, even if it's copied between Office applications, and the Paste Special option allows you to further define how your data is copied or moved. This course is designed to show you many of the ways that Excel 2010 allows you to manipulate data and the worksheets that contain them and describes features that let you do this quickly and efficiently.",microsoft office,Fundamental Skills,0.9943193
,Mover datos y modificar hojas de cálculo en Excel 2010,"
La capacidad de manipular datos con facilidad probablemente sea el mayor beneficio de utilizar aplicaciones de productividad, tales como Excel 2010. Es decir, cuando se deben copiar los mismos datos en repetidas ocasiones o mover grandes cantidades de datos de un lugar a otro dentro de una hoja de cálculo o entre libros, resulta evidente que esto se realiza con mucha más facilidad mediante software que mediante el uso de lápiz y papel. Por ejemplo, las características de Excel 2010, tales como Vista previa dinámica, permiten apreciar cómo se verán los datos copiados antes de copiarlos, incluso si se copian entre aplicaciones de Office, y la opción Pegado especial permite definir aún más cómo copiar o mover los datos. Este curso está diseñado para demostrar muchas de las formas en las que Excel 2010 permite manipular datos y las hojas de cálculo que los contienen y describe las características que permiten hacer esto de manera rápida y eficiente.

Ainsi, parmi les fonctionnalités d'Excel 2010, l'aperçu instantané vous permet de voir comment des données copiées apparaîtront avant que vous ne les copiez réellement, même si elles sont copiées entre plusieurs applications Office, tandis que l'option Collage spécial vous permet de préciser comment vos données sont copiées ou déplacées.

Richness in this learning format is driven by individual commitment to completing the short assignments between scheduled sessions, and sharing that learning with peers and the external RBL Group facilitator.

Program Focus: Strategic HR means creating value for stakeholders outside of HR. HR’s place at the table depends on its ability to use business acumen and an outside-in perspective to identify the organizational capabilities the organization has or needs. These organizational capabilities enable the strategy and create intangible value.

The How HR Creates Value – Virtual Learning Guide Book will be provided to participants after enrollment. This is the reference for participants to complete pre-work for each session. There are 3 sections of the Guide Book to align with the three interactive sessions designed in the curriculum. It is critical and compulsory that participants complete the pre-work for each session to maximize the learnings and for participants to demonstrate they own their development as we advocate to other learners and the business.

,Lean and Six Sigma,"

Six Sigma is a data-driven improvement philosophy that views all activities within an organization as processes whose inputs can be controlled to effect significant improvements in process outputs. Six Sigma uses a rigorous and systematic methodology known as DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and a number of qualitative and quantitative tools for driving process, product, and service improvements aimed at reducing defects and variation. Lean is also an improvement methodology, but with a different focus, aiming to enhance process flow, reduce cycle time, and eliminate waste. Though Lean and Six Sigma originated in different places and under different circumstances, they are now largely seen as complementary methodologies rather than mutually exclusive alternatives. Companies across various industries are striving to become faster and more responsive to customers, achieve near perfect quality, and operate using world-class cost structures. You need both Lean and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. This course explores the relationship between the Lean and Six Sigma approaches and their integrated application in both manufacturing and service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

,Six Sigma Leadership and Change Management,"The enterprise leaders in an organization play the most critical role in Six Sigma success. These leaders affect the deployment of Six Sigma in terms of providing resources, removing roadblocks, managing change, and communicating Six Sigma vision to all organizational members. Though Black Belts are not necessarily a part of the enterprise leadership, knowledge about leadership roles and perspectives helps Black Belts perform their own roles as Six Sigma leaders, and also in their regular interaction with these leaders.  An organization's culture and its inherent structure, lack of resources, and top leadership support sometimes create organizational roadblocks that may result in deployment failures.

,Critical Requirements and Benchmarking for Six Sigma,"The success of Six Sigma deployment in an organization largely depends on the success of individual Six Sigma projects. Organizational stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and employees, have a strong influence on the implementation of Six Sigma projects. In turn, these projects impact the organizational stakeholders by throwing many opportunities and challenges before them. It is imperative that Six Sigma leaders determine the critical quality, cost, process, and delivery requirements from customers and the organization, and then align projects with these requirements. Benchmarking is used in Six Sigma projects to set measurement goals for the critical requirements against world-class and competitive reference points. Benchmarking may also be used at later stages in the projects to evaluate existing operations, compare them with best-in-class organizations, and incorporate best practices to maximize the success of improvement efforts.

,Business Performance and Financial Measures in Six Sigma,"Six Sigma improvement begins with assessing the current performance of an organization's processes and products, and comparing it with the desired performance.

,Motivation and Communication in Six Sigma Teams,"Six Sigma teams must possess specific qualities to succeed throughout the development stages of their life cycles. Leaders who know how to facilitate teams will greatly enhance their chances for project success, which in turn will benefit their organizations. Motivation is one essential component that can optimize a team's focus on accomplishing its assigned goals. By making the teamwork enriching and satisfying to members, leaders can motivate a Six Sigma team with dramatic effects on overall success. Modern motivational theory informs today's motivational techniques, and this course explores both the theoretical origins and the practical application of research on motivation.  Besides motivating individual team members, Black Belts need to proactively promote cohesion through all the challenging stages of a Six Sigma team's tenure. As team leaders, Six Sigma Black Belts need to recognize the stages of team development and choose targeted approaches for optimizing performance at each stage. Throughout all the stages, effective communication is vital for project success. Team communication is often overlooked, and the result can be missed deadlines, confusion, and team frustration if information is not supplied to all intended parties in a timely fashion. In any Six Sigma deployment, a communication plan will be indispensable, outlining the why, what, who, where, and how of project communication. The communication toolkit is extensive, and team leaders need to know how to use the right tool for the job. This course offers strategies for effective team facilitation and communication, exploring basic skills, strategic plans, and useful tools for communication.

,Managing Six Sigma Team Performance,"Six Sigma Black Belts have the challenging task of managing the full spectrum of personal dynamics that characterize project teams. Each team member provides the team with unique strengths and weaknesses, and combining individuals into a team produces varied results. Besides providing the basic tools and structure for smooth team operation, and maintaining the integrity of the project schedule by managing limited team time, Black Belts require the skills to minimize maladaptive team behaviors and optimize positive ones. Black Belts must therefore be aware of the challenges of team dynamics and facilitate methods that resolve any conflicts that arise.  Black Belts must also understand fully the many and diverse tools available for making decisions and solving problems in any Six Sigma project. A number of decision-making tools enable teams to generate and select creative improvement ideas, while a series of management and planning tools enable teams to implement and assess quality improvement throughout an organization. As team leaders with mastery over these tools, Black Belts are called upon to select the right tools to meet various team conditions and objectives. And Black Belts share yet another responsibility throughout a team's tenure: evaluating team performance and rewarding its contributions to the organization.

,Developing Project Charters and Tracking Six Sigma Projects ,"A project charter is the most important document used to initiate and manage a Six Sigma project, and it is treated as an informal contract between an organization and the Six Sigma team. The project charter articulates the problem that the Six Sigma team is going to work on, and the project's scope, goals, and objectives in very clear, specific, and measurable terms. As part of the process of developing a project charter, some performance measures such as cost, revenue, and schedule are identified and developed.

,Process Characteristics for Six Sigma,"To improve the processes behind an organization's products and services, a Six Sigma Black Belt must measure them. But first, they must identify those processes. Among the many Six Sigma tools, several are designed specifically to isolate relevant process variables, determine their relationships to each other, prioritize their importance relative to customer or business requirements, and assess their efficiency. Using SIPOC and cause-and-effect matrices, Black Belts can determine which process inputs to target first – those with the most significant impact on important outputs. Using process efficiency formulas, they can determine the ratio of value-added time to total lead time, then enhance this ratio by reducing that troublesome drag on lead time – work in process. With metrics established, Black Belts can recommend approaches involving takt time, one-piece flow, and pull to balance the flow of processes, eliminating the inefficiencies of work in process, cutting overhead budgets, and reducing lead time. Looking closer at the steps of a given process, Black Belts are then able to wield a number of analysis tools such as spaghetti and Venn diagrams, process maps, and value stream maps to reveal lurking time traps, constraints, and wasted steps – all with a view of improving process characteristics for optimum efficiency.  This course provides strategies to improve the current state of an organization's processes by analyzing the variables of its processes, using metrics to calculate process flow performance, and employing tools to analyze processes. It connects these tools to the overarching goals of eliminating wasted time, highlighting free time, and increasing the proportion of value-added time.

,Data Collection and Measurement in Six Sigma,"An organization's success depends upon how it delivers on its processes. Before Black Belts can begin to improve an organization's processes, they must measure those processes with the appropriate data. The crucial steps of data collection and measurement precede process improvement in any Six Sigma initiative. Successful data collection starts with careful planning; a knowledge of various data types, sampling strategies, and measurement methods; and an ongoing awareness of best practices for ensuring data accuracy and integrity. Only reliable and suitable data will yield dependable analyses that translate into desired process improvements. As Six Sigma team leaders, Black Belts will help to oversee careful data collection efforts during the Measure phase of the Six Sigma DMAIC process. They will determine what should be measured, how data should be collected, and what tools can be employed to gather data as the basis for further improvements.   This course prepares Black Belts for successful data collection by surveying the types of data, measurement scales, sampling methods, and collection techniques available. It offers guidance for ensuring data integrity, pointing to different collecting methods for different informational needs, and recommending best practices for front-line data collectors.

,Six Sigma Measurement Systems,"Six Sigma measurement systems are vital to improving an organization's processes. Measurement systems encompass the conditions, devices, and the human element of measurement, which together must produce correct measurements and comply with appropriate standards. Measurement error, or measurement variability, is a problem whose components must be thoroughly understood and kept in check to maintain the effectiveness of any measurement system. Measurement variability contributes to the overall variability in the process and it is important to understand its sources and minimize it. Black Belts can calculate correlation, bias, linearity, stability, reproducibility, and repeatability to analyze and further improve measurement systems.  This course examines how to analyze a measurement system to help it produce correct measurements and minimize its proportion of variability in the overall variability. It introduces key elements of metrology and international systems of measurement, explores the many sources of measurement error, and surveys a broad range of items that can be measured in various functional areas of the enterprise. The course also presents some of the considerations influencing the use of measurement systems in service industries.

,Basic Statistics and Graphical Methods for Six Sigma,"Organizations must ensure that their processes and products are extremely consistent, as variations can lead to rejected orders, lower revenues, and eventually, financial disaster. Basic statistics can provide Black Belts with the tools to summarize and assess collected data in a meaningful way. Black Belts can use descriptive (enumerative) statistics to tabulate and graphically represent sample data through a number of informative charts and diagrams. Using analytical (inferential) statistics, supported by the central limit theorem, Black Belts can confidently make inferences about the larger population based on their sample data, and can test the statistical validity of their inferences. Thus, basic statistics can provide an organization with a view of its performance in graphical format, and the tools for reaching valid conclusions regarding its processes and products.  This course provides Black Belts with basic statistical tools for describing, presenting, and analyzing sample and population data. It explores the process of preparing and presenting sample data using graphical methods and then making valid inferences about the population represented by the sample.

,Probability for Six Sigma,"Organizations need to make inferences about a population from sample data, and understanding how to calculate the probability that an event will occur is crucial to making those inferences. In a Six Sigma context, it is often important to calculate the likelihood that a combination of events or that an ordered combination of events will occur. Understanding probabilities can provide Black Belts with the tools to make predictions about events or event combinations. To make accurate inferences about a population from the sample data collected in the Measure stage, Black Belts must also be familiar with the characteristics of various probability distributions, and their suitability for different types of data. Understanding the behavior of probability distributions allows the Black Belts to find the probability that values will be found within a given range, and thus to provide information on the variation in the organization's processes and products.   This course provides Black Belts with basic information on probabilities and probability distributions, from the frequently used normal, Poisson, and binomial distributions, to the more specialized hypergeometric, Weibull, bivariate, exponential, and lognormal, as well as the distributions that test hypothesis and set confidence intervals: Chi-square, Student's t, and F distributions. When chosen appropriately to represent the data, these distributions will provide information on process and product variation, and support subsequent inferences based on sample data.

,Process Capability for Six Sigma,"In any improvement initiative, organizations must determine whether their existing processes meet the targets and specifications demanded by the business, or by the customer. Measuring and analyzing the capability and performance of a process under review enables organizations to numerically represent and interpret its current state, and to report its sigma level. When done correctly, process capability analyses enable Black Belts to precisely assess current performance in light of future goals, and ultimately, to determine the need and targets of process improvement. Process capabilities can be determined for normal and non-normal data, and for variable (continuous) and attribute (discrete) data alike.  This course explores the considerations, verifications, and associated calculations used to conduct process capability studies, from choosing parameters and verifying the stability and normality of a given process, to gathering and interpreting capability and performance data using common indices. It also explores the special treatment of non-normal data and attributes data in the context of a capability study.

,Correlation and Regression Analysis in Six Sigma,"As a Six Sigma team moves into the Analyze stage of the DMAIC process, it looks more closely at the variables and variable interrelationships identified during the Measure stage. As part of the analysis, a scatter diagram of dependent and independent variables is drawn to visualize the form, strength, and direction of their relationships. By determining their correlation coefficient, a linear relationship can be quantified and identified as positive, negative, or neutral. Then, using regression analysis, a model is developed to describe the relationship as a linear equation and then used for predictions and estimations. However, it is essential to analyze the uncertainty in the estimate, to test that the relationship between variables is statistically significant, and that the model is valid.  This course discusses two important tools – correlation and regression analysis for measuring and modeling relationships between variables. In terms of correlation, it takes learners through examples of scatter diagrams for two variables, the calculation and interpretation of the correlation coefficient, and the interpretation of its confidence interval. The course also draws learners' attention to some key considerations in correlation analysis, such as correlation and causation. In terms of regression analysis, the course discusses the simple linear regression model, how to create it using sample data, interpret and use it, and conduct a hypothesis test to check that the relationship between the variables is statistically significant.

,Multivariate Analysis and Attribute Data Analysis in Six Sigma,"In the Analyze phase of the DMAIC methodology, a Six Sigma team begins to analyze the root causes of the problems that it identified in the earlier stages. This analysis may require churning out huge volumes of data of different types. Sometimes this data is of a multivariate nature, meaning that many dependent and independent variables need to be considered simultaneously. As such, Six Sigma teams often use advanced multivariate tools to manage this type of data. Data can also be of an attribute nature, for which Six Sigma teams use a different set of data analysis tools for analyzing and interpreting this type of data.  This course deals with the tools used in Six Sigma for multivariate analysis and attribute data analysis.

,Hypothesis Testing Concepts and Tests for Means in Six Sigma,"In the Analyze phase of the DMAIC methodology, Six Sigma teams analyze the underlying causes of issues that need to be addressed for the successful completion of their improvement projects. To that end, teams conduct a number of statistical analyses to determine the nature of variables and their interrelationships in the process under study. It is rarely possible to study and analyze the full scope of population data pertaining to all processes, products, or services, so Six Sigma teams typically collect samples of the population data to be analyzed, and based on that sample data, they make hypotheses about the entire population. Because there is a lot at stake in forming the correct conclusions about the larger population, Six Sigma teams validate their inferences using hypothesis tests.  This course builds on basic hypothesis testing concepts, terminologies, and some of the most commonly used hypothesis tests – one- and two-sample tests for means. The course also discusses the importance of sample size and power in hypothesis testing, as well as exploring issues relating to point estimators and confidence intervals in hypothesis testing.

,"Tests for Variances and Proportions, ANOVA, and Chi-square Tests in Six Sigma","As a Six Sigma team moves into the Analyze phase of a project, team members begin analyzing the information and data collected in the earlier phases. During the Analyze phase, Six Sigma teams identify possible sources of variation, underlying root causes, and areas for improvement. It is here where assumptions or hypotheses about a process, product, or service are made and validated using tests based on sample data.  This course aims to familiarize you with some of the advanced hypothesis tests used in Six Sigma. You are taken through the key steps in testing hypotheses for proportions, variances, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), and their underlying assumptions, with the help of examples and case studies.

,Nonparametric Tests in Six Sigma Analysis,"Hypothesis testing is a process of assuming an initial claim about the population characteristics and then statistically testing this claim using sample data. Testing hypotheses is a very important activity in Six Sigma projects in the areas of analysis, decision making, and change implementation. In conventional hypothesis tests – called parametric tests – a sample statistic is obtained to estimate a population parameter and hence requires a number of assumptions to be made about the underlying population; such as the normality of data. However, another category of hypothesis tests – called nonparametric tests – is used when some of these assumptions (such as normality of data) cannot be safely made. Nonparametric tests require fewer assumptions and are often used when the data is from an unknown or non-normal population. Nonparametric tests are not completely free from assumptions, however. For instance, they still require the data to be from an independent random sample. The course aims to familiarize learners with approaches for analyzing nonparametric data, particularly the use of four nonparametric tests for validating hypotheses: Mood's Median tests, Levene's tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Mann-Whitney tests.

,Nonstatistical Analysis Methods in Six Sigma,"Getting to the source of why something has gone wrong in a system or process is critical to identifying the changes necessary for resolving the problem. During the Analyze phase of a Six Sigma project, a Black Belt practitioner utilizes a variety of statistical and nonstatistical tools and methods for analyzing systems and processes to identify variation and defects, reduce costs, eliminate waste, and reduce cycle time. While many of the tools used in the Analyze phase are statistical and quantitative in nature, there are many useful nonstatistical methods. Nonstatistical methods help in the analysis by including qualitative considerations in identifying potential problems, their root causes, and their impacts. They help prioritize these causes and generate initial ideas for resolving problems when a project enters the Improve phase.   This course covers the use of various nonstatistical analysis methods including failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), gap analysis, scenario planning, root cause analysis, the 5 Whys, fault tree analysis (FTA), and waste analysis.

,Designing and Planning Experiments in Six Sigma,"Six Sigma teams concluding the Analyze phase with a well-understood problem strive in the Improve phase to generate a well-designed solution. Design of experiments (DOE) is a controlled approach to experimentation that enables teams to systematically change the level of one or more input factors and observe the effects on the targeted response. If teams exercise care in choosing the right design – including suitable factors, levels, and responses – their experiments can reveal the precise combination of factors that will optimize the response. Later, that combination will be tested, validated, and ultimately implemented to effect the desired process improvement.  This course surveys the concepts that are fundamental to design of experiments methodology, including the basic elements of experiments; principles for minimizing the effects of error, noise, and aliasing; and strategies for designing experiments with a maximum of power and resolution within the practical realities of resource and time constraints. The focus is on the planning stage of DOE, when teams set experimental objectives; select the factors, levels, and responses to be studied; choose the best experimental design; and prepare to run the experiments. In describing these activities, the course explores the questions teams should consider at each stage of planning, and it provides recommendations for building a design to meet a variety of needs.

,Fundamentals of Lean and Six Sigma and their Applications,"
Six Sigma is a data-driven improvement strategy that views all activities within an organization as processes. Process inputs can be controlled and adjusted to effect significant improvements in process outputs. Six Sigma uses a rigorous and systematic methodology known as DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and a number of qualitative and quantitative tools. Its goal is to drive process, product, and service improvements for reducing variation and defects. Lean is also an improvement methodology, but with a different focus. It aims to enhance process flow, reduce cycle time, and eliminate waste. Though Lean and Six Sigma originated in different places and under different circumstances, they are now largely seen as complementary methodologies. Organizations across various industries are striving to become faster and more responsive to customers, achieve near-perfect quality, and operate using world-class cost structures. You need both Lean and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. This course introduces Six Sigma and Lean methodologies and looks at the relationship between them. It also explores relationships among business systems and processes using some practical examples of Lean Six Sigma applications in both manufacturing and service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft’s ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.

,Determining Requirements by Listening to the Voice of the Customer in Six Sigma,"
Customers are at the heart of all Six Sigma initiatives, and this focus on customers is what makes Six Sigma an outstanding organizational performance improvement program. The voice of the customer (VOC) is a Six Sigma strategy used to capture requirements and feedback from customers in order to meet their requirements. Voice of the customer is a critical input at every stage in the Six Sigma DMAIC process, particularly at the Define stage. At this stage, critical customer requirements concerning quality, cost, process, and delivery are collected and translated into measurable, actionable project goals using a number of tools. Using VOC begins with defining Six Sigma goals for collecting and analyzing customer requirements. It is imperative that Six Sigma leaders determine the critical to x (CTx) requirements concerning quality, cost, process, and delivery requirements of customers and the organization. Then the team needs to identify and select the most effective methods for collecting customer feedback and requirements. From there, customer requirements are translated into measurable, actionable project goals. This course examines how an organization uses the voice of the customer to define the problem at hand and to set the direction of its Six Sigma efforts. It discusses some common customer data collection methods – such as surveys, interviews, and focus groups – and looks at how to ensure validity and reliability in data collection. In addition, the course illustrates how tools such as CTx, SIPOC, Kano analysis, critical-to-quality (CTQ) analysis, and quality function deployment (QFD) are used to translate customer data into critical customer requirements and actionable goals for the Six Sigma team. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

,Process Flow Metrics and Analysis Tools for Six Sigma,"
To improve the processes behind an organization's products and services, a Six Sigma Black Belt must measure them. Among the many Six Sigma tools, several are designed specifically to identify and prioritize process input and output variables and their importance relative to customer or business requirements. Using cause-and-effect matrices, Black Belts can determine which process inputs to target first. Using process efficiency formulas, they can determine the ratio of value-added time to total lead time, then enhance this ratio by reducing that troublesome drag on lead time – work in process. With metrics established, Black Belts can recommend approaches to balance the flow of processes and determine the impact that 'hidden factories' could have on process flow metrics. Looking closer at the steps of a given process, Black Belts are then able to wield a number of analysis tools such as flowcharts, spaghetti diagrams, process maps, value stream maps, and gemba walk to reveal lurking time traps, constraints, and wasted steps – all with a view of improving process characteristics for optimum efficiency. This course provides strategies to measure the current state of an organization's processes by analyzing the variables of its processes, using metrics to calculate process flow performance, and employing tools to analyze processes. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

,Probability and Probability Distributions in Six Sigma,"
Organizations need to make inferences about a population from sample data, and understanding how to calculate the probability that an event will occur is crucial to making those inferences. In a Six Sigma context, it is often important to calculate the likelihood that a combination of events or that an ordered combination of events will occur. Understanding probabilities can provide Black Belts with the tools to make predictions about events or event combinations. To make accurate inferences about a population from the sample data collected in the Measure stage, Black Belts must also be familiar with the characteristics of various probability distributions, and their suitability for different types of data. Understanding the behavior of probability distributions allows the Black Belts to find the probability that values will be found within a given range, and thus to provide information on the variation in the organization's processes and products. This course provides Black Belts with basic information on probabilities and probability distributions, from the frequently used normal, Poisson, and binomial distributions, to the more specialized hypergeometric, Weibull, bivariate, exponential, and lognormal, as well as the distributions that test hypothesis and set confidence intervals: Chi-square, Student's t, and F distributions. When chosen appropriately to represent the data, these distributions will provide information on process and product variation, and support subsequent inferences based on sample data. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

,Determining Process Performance and Capability in Six Sigma,"
In any improvement initiative, organizations must determine whether their existing processes meet the targets and specifications demanded by the customer, or by the business. Measuring and analyzing the capability and performance of a process under review enables organizations to numerically represent and interpret its current state, and to report its sigma level. When done correctly, process capability analyses enable Black Belts to precisely assess current performance in light of future goals, and ultimately, to determine the need and targets of process improvement. Process capabilities can be determined for normal and non-normal data, variable (continuous) and attribute (discrete) data, and for long- and short-term alike. This course explores key considerations and calculations used in determining process capability and performance. This includes choosing parameters, verifying the stability and normality of a given process, and gathering and interpreting capability and performance data using common indices. The course also explores the special treatment of non-normal data and attributes data in the context of a capability study and long-and short-term capability. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.

,Basics of Hypothesis Testing and Tests for Means in Six Sigma,"
In the Analyze phase of the DMAIC methodology, Six Sigma teams analyze the underlying causes of issues that need to be addressed for the successful completion of their improvement projects. To that end, teams conduct a number of statistical analyses to determine the nature of variables and their interrelationships in the process under study. It is rarely possible to study and analyze the full scope of population data pertaining to all processes, products, or services, so Six Sigma teams typically collect samples of the population data to be analyzed, and based on that sample data, they make hypotheses about the entire population. Because there is a lot at stake in forming the correct conclusions about the larger population, Six Sigma teams validate their inferences using hypothesis tests. This course builds on basic hypothesis testing concepts, terminologies, and some of the most commonly used hypothesis tests – one- and two-sample tests for means. The course also discusses the importance of sample size and power in hypothesis testing, as well as exploring issues relating to point estimators and confidence intervals in hypothesis testing. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.

,FMEA and Other Nonstatistical Analysis Methods in Six Sigma,"
Getting to the source of why something has gone wrong in a system or process is critical to identifying the changes necessary for resolving the problem. During the Analyze phase of a Six Sigma project, a Black Belt practitioner utilizes a variety of statistical and nonstatistical tools and methods for analyzing systems and processes to identify variation and defects, reduce costs, eliminate waste, and reduce cycle time. While many of the tools used in the Analyze phase are statistical and quantitative in nature, there are many useful nonstatistical methods. Nonstatistical methods help in the analysis by including qualitative considerations in identifying potential problems, their root causes, and their impacts. They help prioritize these causes and generate initial ideas for resolving problems when a project enters the Improve phase. This course covers the use of various nonstatistical analysis methods including failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), gap analysis, scenario planning, root cause analysis, the 5 Whys, fault tree analysis (FTA), and waste analysis. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

,"Designing, Conducting, and Analyzing Experiments in Six Sigma","
Six Sigma teams design and conduct experiments to investigate the relationships between input variables and response variables. By controlling and changing the input variables and observing the effects on the response variables, a Six Sigma team gains a deep understanding of these relationships. After determining what and how much needs to be changed to meet the desired improvement, teams generate solution ideas based on the best combination of input variables' settings to optimize the response, and then the ideas are tested, implemented, and validated. Later in the Control stage, efforts are made to keep the improved processes, products, or services under statistical control and to retain the gains. This course explores full and fractional factorial designs and the DOE process. In addition, it teaches how to select, test, and validate solutions using a variety of analysis, screening, and testing tools commonly used in Six Sigma.

,Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Control Charts in Six Sigma,"
Ensuring a process is in control is critical to any Six Sigma project, but how do you determine with certainty if a process is on track or requires improvement? Where do you find the 'proof' or solid facts that a process is out of control and requires intervention? By applying statistical process control (SPC) methods, a Six Sigma team can identify and control variation in a process. This course covers the basic concepts in statistical process control methodology, including the selection of variables and rational subgrouping. One of the most important tools used in SPC methodology is the control chart, and this course explores how to select the right control chart for the variables being measured, and how to interpret specific patterns they reveal.

,"Common DFSS Methodologies, Design for X, and Robust Designs","
Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is the methodology associated with the design of a process, product, or service, which results in Six Sigma output that satisfies both the external customer and internal business requirements. DFSS is an innovative strategy for the design or redesign of a process, product, or service from the ground up. This course examines several of the common methodologies utilized in Design for Six Sigma (DFSS), beginning with the two common counterparts to the DMAIC methodology: DMADV and DMADOV. Design for X is emerging as an important knowledge-based multifunctional approach to design that is aimed at particular prioritized process constraints, such as cost, manufacturability, testability, or maintainability. This course explores several constraints in more detail, offering strategies for achieving designs concentrated on the chosen criteria. Another recently developed approach, robust design, uses parameter and tolerance control to produce designs which will be reliable during manufacturing and while in use. This course will address the basic aims of parameter control, tolerance design, and statistical tolerancing.

,Working for Your Inner Boss: Personal Accountability,"Most employees in business organizations must answer to someone else. From the top of the organization chart to the bottom, nearly every manager and employee must look to a supervisor, a director, or even a customer to establish priorities, assign tasks, set deadlines, and evaluate results. Whoever gives this direction is called the boss. On one level, the boss decides how employees will perform their jobs. How well an employee meets requirements set by the boss determines whether that employee succeeds or fails, receives rewards or penalties, and earns praise or criticism. On another level however, the judgment of an external boss isn't enough to make a job personally fulfilling and rewarding. That's something all employees of an organization decide for themselves. Everyone who works must also answer to an inner boss, a personal, internal voice that provides guidance on whether a job is worth doing and whether it is done well. Accepting personal accountability for your work means your inner boss sets demanding standards and that you're willing to commit to meeting those standards and answer for the results of your work. In this course, you'll learn how to listen to your own inner boss, how to identify your internal standards, how to create a plan to meet those standards, and how to apply your inner boss's guidance to gain more control over your work, your goals, and your future.",business,,0.98022217

In seiner englischsprachigen Publikation „Occupational Stress“ schreibt Stephen Palmer sinngemäß: Stress ist die Reaktion, die ein Mensch auf psychologischer und körperlicher Ebene sowie in seinem Verhalten zeigt, wenn er zwischen den an ihn gestellten Ansprüchen und seiner Fähigkeit, diese zu erfüllen, eine Unausgewogenheit wahrnimmt, die über einen längeren Zeitraum zur Erkrankung führt. Bürden Sie sich selbst ständig neue Aufgaben auf, sodass Sie den Eindruck gewinnen, dass die Liste nie kürzer wird? Fühlen Sie sich in der Arbeit und zu Hause überfordert? Befürchten Sie, dass Stress sich allmählich negativ auf Ihre Gesundheit und Ihre Beziehungen auswirkt. Stress wird nicht etwa durch externe Ereignisse, sondern durch Ihre eigenen Gefühle und Reaktionen in Bezug auf dieselben verursacht. Wenngleich Sie nicht immer in der Lage sein dürften, auf externe Ereignisse einzuwirken, die Ihnen Stress verursachen, können Sie doch Ihre Reaktion und Ihre Umgangsweise mit solchen Ereignissen steuern. In diesem Kurs werden Anzeichen und Symptome von Stress erläutert, die in Form körperlicher und psychologischer Reaktionen oder in Verhaltensweisen zum Ausdruck kommen können. Zugleich wird auch auf die Ursache für solches Stressempfinden eingegangen. Im Rahmen des Kurses werden Strategien zur Stressbewältigung und zum Vermeiden von Erschöpfungszuständen (Burnout) behandelt.

,Optimizing Your Work/Life Balance: Taking Control of Your Stress,"

In 'Occupational Stress,' Stephen Palmer wrote 'Stress is the psychological, physiological and behavioral response by an individual when they perceive a lack of equilibrium between the demands placed upon them and their ability to meet those demands, which, over a period of time, leads to ill-health.' Are you constantly adding items to your to-do list and it seems like your list never shrinks? Are you feeling overwhelmed at work and at home? Are you afraid that stress is starting to negatively impact your health and relationships? Stress is produced by your own feelings and reactions to certain external events, rather than by the events themselves. And while you may not always be able to control the external events that are causing you stress, you can control your reactions to them and how you handle them. This course will explain how the signs and symptoms of stress could be of physiological, behavioral, and psychological nature and where these stresses can come from. This course reviews strategies for coping with stress and avoiding burnout. The course also covers how you can positively change your responses to stress once you are able to recognize how you respond to stressful situations. Relaxation techniques such as breathing and mediation are also covered. Materials designed to support blended learning activities aligned with this course are available from the Resources Page.

,改进你的工作∕生活平衡：控制你的压力,"
斯蒂芬·帕尔默在《职业压力》一书中写道：“压力是个人在感到置放在他们身上的需求与实现需求的能力发生失衡时所产生的心理、生理和行为反应。这种反应如果持续较长时间，会对人体健康造成伤害”。你是否不断地为你的任务列表添加新的事项，而且任务列表的长度从未缩短？你是否在工作过程中和在家庭生活中感到不堪重负？你是否担心压力会影响你的健康和人际关系？压力是由你对特定外部事件的感觉和反应造成的，而不是由事件本身造成的。尽管你可能无法总是控制会给你带来压力的外部事件，但你可以控制你对它们的反应以及处理它们的方法。 本课程将解释压力的体征和症状的心理、行为和生理属性，并说明压力从何而来。本课程将阐述应对压力和避免精疲力竭的策略。本课程还将阐明在了解了自己对压力状况作出反应的原理后，你可以怎样积极地改变你对压力的反应。深呼吸和冥想等放松技巧同样也将在本课程中有所涉及。

,Diversity on the Job: The Importance of Diversity and the Changing Workplace,"Imagine for a minute that you work in a place where everyone is the same. All of your coworkers are of the same ethnicity, gender, educational background, and socioeconomic standing. Would you be able to easily generate new ideas? Would the group have the ability to understand things from a different point of view? Without diversity in the workplace, organizations run the risk of becoming monocultural and only viewing things from a very limited perspective. The organization provides the structure for operation of the business and often defines the culture, but it's the individuals interacting within the organization who carry out the mission of the organization.  Rather than address the legal underpinnings and requirements related to diversity, this course focuses on how to leverage the diversity that exists within the organization. It defines diversity and dispels some common myths that surround the topic of diversity. The importance of diversity within the ever-changing workplace is described, including the impact of globalization.

Les principaux éléments qui viennent gaspiller cette précieuse denrée sont les voleurs de temps : cette multitude de contrariétés, de tâches insignifiantes et de contraintes administratives qui peut facilement dévorer vos journées. Vous découvrirez peut-être de surcroît que certains de vos propres comportements affectent votre bonne gestion du temps. Par exemple, vous pouvez être de ces personnes qui remettent tout au lendemain, ou encore de celles qui ont du mal à refuser du travail supplémentaire. Ces comportements peuvent réduire votre efficacité et générer de plus un stress inutile. Ce cours présente des stratégies permettant de gérer les voleurs de temps courants (la procrastination et l'acceptation d'une charge trop importante de travail), ainsi que la manière de traiter les interruptions. Il vous montre de quelle manière une gestion efficace du temps peut vous aider à vous concentrer sur le travail qui est réellement productif tout en traitant de manière professionnelle et rapide vos voleurs de temps.

,Управление временем: борьба с «пожирателями времени»,"
Время — это ценный и невозобновляемый ресурс, и от того, насколько эффективно вы его используете, зависит ваш успех в работе и в личной жизни. Часто мы тратим этот важный ресурс впустую из-за так называемых «пожирателей времени» — помех, рутинных задач и административных обязанностей, на которые могут уходить целые дни. Кроме того, на то, насколько эффективно вы управляете временем, может влиять ваше собственное поведение. Например, вы можете до последнего откладывать работу или не уметь сказать нет, когда вас просят взять на себя еще пару задач. Такое поведение снижает эффективность и порождает ненужные стрессовые ситуации. В этом курсе основное внимание уделяется стратегиям борьбы с распространенными «пожирателями времени», а также помехами. Вы узнаете, как эффективное управление временем поможет вам сконцентрироваться на продуктивной работе, быстро и профессионально справляясь с «пожирателями времени».

,Probleme lösen: Grundlagen,"
""Das Problem am Problem"", so Autor und Psychiater Theodore Rubin ""ist nicht, dass es überhaupt Probleme gibt. Das Problem ist, dass man das Gegenteil erwartet und glaubt, dass es ein Problem ist, ein Problem zu haben."" Ein Problem ist eine Frage oder Situation, die Zweifel, Ratlosigkeit oder Schwierigkeiten widerspiegelt. Sie ist eine Angelegenheit, die korrigiert oder überwunden werden muss, um einen gewünschten Zustand zu erreichen. Das Lösen von Problemen erfordert zielgerichtetes Denken und Handeln in Situationen, für die es keine vorgefertigten Lösungen gibt. Jeder Mensch löst tagtäglich, bewusst oder unbewusst, Probleme in seinem privaten oder beruflichen Leben. Sie können jedoch Ihre Erfolge beim Lösen von Problemen wesentlich steigern, indem Sie sich mit dem Problemlösungsprozess besser vertraut machen, sich wichtige Fähigkeiten und erforderliche Kompetenzen aneignen sowie ein Bewusstsein für die Denk- und Vorgehensfehler entwickeln, die diesen Prozess beeinträchtigen. Dieser Kurs führt Sie durch die wesentlichen Komponenten beim Problemlösen und erläutert einige seiner Herausforderungen.

,Resolución de problemas: fundamentos,"
""El problema"", afirma el escritor y psiquiatra Theodore Rubin, ""no es que existan problemas. El problema es esperar lo contrario y pensar que tener problemas es un problema"". Un problema es una cuestión o situación que genera duda, confusión o dificultad. Se trata de un asunto que debe corregirse o superarse para alcanzar un estado deseado. La resolución de problemas implica pensar y actuar, con objetivos específicos, en situaciones para las que no existen soluciones preparadas. A diario todas las personas, de forma consciente o inconsciente, resuelven problemas vinculados a su vida personal o laboral. Sin embargo, la efectividad de la resolución de problemas puede mejorar considerablemente si se obtiene un mejor entendimiento sobre el proceso de resolución de problemas, las habilidades esenciales y las competencias necesarias; y si se conocen las trampas mentales y las dificultades que obstaculizan el proceso. Este curso explica los conceptos esenciales de la resolución de problemas y analiza algunos de sus desafíos.

,Résolution des problèmes : Éléments fondamentaux,"
D'après Théodore Rubin, auteur et psychiatre, « Le problème n'est pas que nous avons des problèmes. Le problème est de s'attendre à ne pas avoir de problèmes et de penser que d'avoir des problèmes est vraiment un problème. ». Un problème est une question ou une situation présentant un doute, une complexité ou une difficulté. Il s'agit d'une question devant être traitée ou surmontée afin d'atteindre un état souhaité. La résolution des problèmes implique de réfléchir aux objectifs et d'adopter des actions en conséquence dans des situations pour lesquelles il n'existe aucune solution toute faite. Que ce soit conscient ou inconscient, tout le monde résout chaque jour des problèmes liés à sa vie privée ou professionnelle. Vous pouvez cependant grandement améliorer votre efficacité en la matière en comprenant davantage le processus de résolution des problèmes, les compétences essentielles et les aptitudes requises, ainsi qu'en étant conscient des pièges mentaux et des embûches qui affaiblissent le processus. Ce cours vous présente les éléments essentiels liés à la résolution des problèmes et explore certains de ses défis.

Według słów psychiatry Theodore'a Rubin'a, 'Problemem nie jest to, że istnieją problemy. Problemem jest oczekiwanie, że będzie inaczej i myślenie, że doświadczanie problemów jest problemem.' Problem jest pytaniem lub sytuacją, która tworzy wątpliwości, konsternację lub trudność. To sprawa, która musi zostać naprawiona lub przezwyciężona w celu osiągnięcia pożądanego stanu. Rozwiązywanie problemów obejmuje myślenie i działanie zorientowane na cel w sytuacjach, w których nie istnieją żadne gotowe rozwiązania. Świadomie bądź nie, każdy rozwiązuje problemy związane ze swoim życiem osobistym lub pracą. Jednakże, możesz znacząco poprawić swoją skuteczność w ich rozwiązywaniu przez zyskanie lepszego zrozumienia procesu rozwiązywania problemów, podstawowych umiejętności oraz wymaganych kompetencji, jak również świadomości pułapek myślowych i niebezpieczeństw, które niekorzystnie wpływają na proces.

,Rozwiązywanie problemów: Schodząc głębiej,"
Norman Vincent Peale, który podkreślał potrzebę analizowania problemu na poziomie szczegółów, powiedział kiedyś „Gdy powstaje problem, badaj go do momentu uzyskania całkowitej wiedzy na jego temat. Następnie znajdź słaby punkt, rozłóż problem na części, a reszta będzie łatwa”. Oparta na faktach, uczciwa analiza następuje na dwóch kluczowych etapach procesu rozwiązywania problemów: najpierw, gdy analizujesz problemy, by odkryć przyczyny źródłowe, a potem, gdy oceniasz i analizujesz potencjalne rozwiązania, by ustalić, które ma największe szanse odniesienia sukcesu. Do analizy i oceny na każdym etapie używanych jest wiele narzędzi. Przykładami narzędzi pomocnych w odnalezieniu przyczyn źródłowych problemu są wykres przyczynowo-skutkowy oraz analiza pięciu pytań „dlaczego”. Analiza kosztów i zysków oraz analiza pola sił pomagają w wyborze najlepszego rozwiązania. Ten kurs pomaga w rozpoznaniu wartości szczerej, opartej na faktach analizy i pokazuje, w jaki sposób zastosowanie kilku narzędzi znacząco pomaga w określaniu przyczyn źródłowych problemu i najlepszego rozwiązania. W pierwszej kolejności kurs omawia analizę problemów, przedstawia kolejne kroki w analizie problemów oraz narzędzia stosowane do odkrywania przyczyn źródłowych. Następnie opisuje, w jaki sposób stosować ocenę i analizę podczas wyboru najlepszego rozwiązania spośród dostępnych alternatyw, jak również niektóre inne pomocne narzędzia.

Norman Vincent Peale, que enfatizou a necessidade de analisar um problema em nível granular, disse certa vez: ""Quando um problema surgir, estude-o até que você o entenda completamente. Então, identifique esse ponto fraco, fragmente o problema, e o resto será fácil"". Uma análise honesta baseada em fatos é feita em duas etapas principais no processo de resolução de problema: primeiro, quando você analisa os problemas para identificar as causas e, depois, quando você avalia e analisa as soluções potenciais para determinar aquela que tem a maior chance de sucesso. Várias ferramentas são usadas para análise e avaliação em cada uma dessas etapas. O diagrama de causa e efeito e a análise dos cinco porquês são exemplos de ferramentas que ajudar a localizar as causas do problema. A análise de custo-benefício e de campo de força ajudam na escolha da melhor solução. Este curso ajuda você a reconhecer o valor da análise honesta baseada em fatos e demonstra como a aplicação de algumas ferramentas é extremamente útil para determinar a causa de um problema e a melhor solução. Primeiro, o curso aborda a análise do problema, ilustra as etapas a serem seguidas durante a análise e descreve as ferramentas usadas para descobrir as causas. Depois, ele descreve como usar a avaliação e a análise ao escolher a melhor solução entre as alternativas disponíveis, bem como algumas ferramentas que você pode usar para ajudá-los nas suas tentativas.

Napoleon Bonaparte hat einmal gesagt: ""Nichts ist schwieriger und darum wertvoller als die Fähigkeit, zu entscheiden."" Eine gute Entscheidung zu treffen, bedeutet, diejenige Vorgehensweise auszuwählen, die den Ertrag der von Ihnen eingesetzten Ressourcen optimiert. Bevor Sie jedoch eine gute Entscheidung treffen können, müssen Sie zunächst Ihre Alternativen ermitteln und bewerten. Glücklicherweise stehen Ihnen eine Reihe von Instrumenten und Techniken zur Verfügung, mit denen Sie den Prozess formalisieren können, Alternativen zu ermitteln, diese sorgsam zu bewerten und schließlich auf der Basis der verfügbaren Informationen die bestmögliche Entscheidung zu treffen. Mithilfe dieser Instrumente potenziert sich Ihr stärkstes Kapital für das Treffen einer guten Entscheidung: Ihre Intelligenz und Ihr gesunder Menschenverstand. Dieser Kurs erläutert verschiedene Instrumente und Techniken, die in den drei wichtigsten Phasen des Entscheidungsprozesses (Entwickeln, Bewerten und Auswählen von Entscheidungsalternativen) eingesetzt werden können. Mithilfe der Nominalgruppentechnik (NGT) werden ein Brainstorming und eine Priorisierung der Alternativen in Gruppenarbeit durchgeführt.

They also check to see what others are thinking before starting down a path of thinking that snowballs into some inaccurate conclusion. Assumptions can get in the way of thinking rationally, critically, and unemotionally. We cannot eliminate all assumptions, but we can do a good job coming to terms with them as a natural, sometimes helpful, but often problematic part of our thinking process.

Even if you've verified assumptions and evaluated a variety of arguments related to an issue – you still have to reach the point of conclusion. A good conclusion is based on sorting through and out the data, getting critiques from others, and drawing it out/depicting it in a way that others can understand. In this course, you will analyze the process of drawing a conclusion into its logical components.

,Основы управления проектами,"В процессе развития бизнес-стратегий возросло понимание того, что управление должно осуществляться на основе четкого представления о желаемых результатах. Все чаще менеджерами проектов назначают сотрудников более низких уровней, так как именно они четко осознают, какой результат должен быть получен по завершении проекта и как достичь качественных и количественных показателей, установленных менеджерами высшего звена. Управление проектами представляет собой процесс наблюдения и контроля над выполнением работ. Выполнение четко определенных процессов управления проектами в сочетании с применением опыта и навыков отдельных работников позволило многим предпринимателям изменить способ мышления, поскольку они получили возможность черпать ресурсы для развития своих управленческих и лидерских качеств внутри компании.

,Project Management Overview (PMBOK® Guide Fifth Edition),"

Every project is different. Some are small and straight forward. Others are large and complex. Most are somewhere in the middle. Even though every project is unique, they all have certain attributes in common. Every project has a similar life cycle, starting with an idea, progressing through development, and culminating in the delivery of a finished product or service. A product has a life cycle of its own which is tied into – yet distinct from – the life cycle of the project. All projects have similar overall phases, such as the start up phase, the planning and design phase, the production phase, and the closing phase. That is all straightforward, but how do a project's phases relate to the stages of its life cycle? Do the natural phases of a project affect the way it is managed? And what types of project management processes should be applied to the specific phases? These are all fundamental questions project managers ask. This course answers these questions and more. It is designed to give project managers and project team members a solid understanding about the nature of projects, how they are structured, and how the structures affect the way they are managed. Specifically, it introduces the concepts of project life cycle, product life cycle, project phases, and project management Process Groups. It provides an in depth look at how the project management phases interact with each other and with the elements of the project life cycle. The course illustrates these concepts through many examples of small and large projects. Learners will also be introduced to the fundamental source of information for project management professionals: the Project Management Institute (PMI®) and A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fifth Edition published by PMI®. The course will identify key project management concepts and terms, explore the PMBOK® Guide, and the project management Knowledge Areas. This course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations. This course will assist in preparing the learner for the PMI® certification exam. This course is aligned with the PMBOK® Guide - Fifth Edition, published by PMI® Inc., 2013.

,Vue d'ensemble du management de projet (Guide PMBOK® – Cinquième édition),"Les projets sont tous différents les uns des autres. Certains sont petits et simples. D'autres sont gros et complexes. La plupart se situent entre les deux. Bien que chaque projet ait son identité propre, tous les projets ont des attributs en commun. Tous les projets ont un cycle de vie similaire, qui commence par une idée, se poursuit par le développement de cette idée et se termine par la livraison d'un produit fini ou d'un service. Le produit a son propre cycle de vie, qui se combine au cycle de vie du projet, tout en s'en différenciant. Les projets ont tous des phases similaires : la phase de démarrage, la phase de planification et de conception, la phase de production et la phase de clôture. Tout cela va de soi, mais il importe cependant d'identifier le rapport qui existe entre les phases d'un projet et les phases du cycle de vie de ce projet. Les phases naturelles d'un projet affectent-elles la manière dont le projet est géré ? Quels types de processus de management de projet doivent être appliqués aux phases spécifiques ? Ce sont les questions fondamentales que se posent les chefs de projet. Ce cours répond à ces questions et à bien d'autres encore. Il s'adresse aux chefs de projet et aux membres des équipes de projet et leur apporte une connaissance solide de la nature des projets, des structures des projets et de la manière dont ces structures affectent le mode de management de ces projets.

,The Role of Ethics in Project Management,"Do the right thing but make sure you do it on time, under budget, and within scope, all the while maintaining your professional integrity in a constantly evolving global business environment. How do project managers do it, given that most ethical dilemmas are not black and white and usually require diligent deliberation? Keeping with their vision of establishing project management as a professional industry, the project management community and the Project Management Institute (PMI®) have established standards of ethics to help members to navigate the sometimes murky waters of ethical issues.  In this course, learners will be given an overview of the role of ethics in project management. Specifically, learners will be introduced to the Project Management Institute (PMI®) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. These are standards that are supported by values identified by practitioners around the world as essential to ensure the integrity of the project management profession. In addition, the course covers the consequences of unethical choices and behavior, including their far-reaching impact on the project management community, the global business community, and society. It provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

,Core PMI® Values and Ethical Standards,"As a project manager, you will inevitably be called upon to address ethical dilemmas. The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI® Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas.

,Introduction to Program Management,"The relationship between program and project management can be thought of in terms of climbing a ladder. Program management is the subsequent rung after project management. For example, project managers regularly balance many projects with varying deadlines and responsibilities – all at the same time. In a similar way, program managers must balance multiple programs, consisting of many different projects. When in a program management environment, there is an entirely new set of skills and knowledge a program manager must possess in order to be successful in this role.  This course provides an introduction to program management and the roles and responsibilities required of the program manager. Specifically, learners will be introduced to the importance of program management and the value of a program manager to the success of an organization; the differences between project, program, and portfolio management, and the interactions among them.

,Program Life Cycle and Benefits Management,"Regardless of the industry, programs and program management help organizations effectively implement corporate strategies. To achieve the planned benefits and outcomes of your program, you need to manage its benefits across its life cycle. This life cycle will vary, depending on the type of program. However, if you understand the general phases in the program life cycle, you can adapt the life cycle model and program benefits to satisfy the strategic goals that your program aims to meet.   This course describes the program life cycle, including why it's important to organize programs into phases, the key distinctions between program and project life cycles, and how program benefits and governance are managed across the life cycle. Also covered are the activities carried out in each phase of the program life cycle, with examples from different program scenarios.

,IT Project Management Essentials: Initiating and Planning IT Projects,"If you want your IT project to complete successfully, you need to get it off to a good start. During the early stages of a project – the initiating and planning phases – a project manager should clarify objectives and requirements and create a project plan that delineates, among other things, what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and how much it will likely cost. Although the plan may change as the project progresses, it’s important to get down as much detail as you can at the very beginning. This course describes how to initiate an IT project effectively. It then focuses on three key areas of planning – developing a work breakdown structure, schedule planning, and cost planning.",project management,IT Project Management Essentials,0.70235354
,IT Project Management Essentials: Executing IT Projects,"The execution phase in an IT project is when the work gets going and the plan is transformed into action and results. From the start of this phase, it's important for the project manager to establish regular communications with project stakeholders – management, the development team, sponsors, and others – to keep them informed on how the project is progressing. In addition to communicating regularly with stakeholders, a project manager should ensure that the team works well together and that the deliverables are meeting the quality standards, as well as other objectives, set in the project plan. This course describes strategies for maintaining a cohesive project team, outlines ways to communicate project information to different stakeholders, and describes how to keep quality on track during the execution phase of a project.",project management,IT Project Management Essentials,0.7881507
,IT Project Management Essentials: Monitoring and Controlling IT Projects,"The aim of project monitoring and control is to compare actual progress and performance against the project plan. An IT project manager must analyze any variances from the plan and identify what actions may need to be taken. If project managers don't monitor their projects on a regular basis, they won't know which tasks are behind schedule or over budget, or what the issues or risks are. IT projects can be complex, with many variables, and it's important that project managers know, at all times, how the project is progressing and what is causing any slippages. This course describes how to monitor the progress of an IT project, analyze variances from the project plan, and control changes that may be requested during a project's life cycle.",project management,IT Project Management Essentials,0.7090152
,IT Project Management Essentials: Managing Risks in an IT Project,"IT project managers deal with risks every day, including potential cost overruns, schedule delays, design constraints, hardware defects, and software bugs. Without a plan or process in place to address the possibility of unpredictable and unwanted loss during a project, managers may be dealing with risks reactively, rather than proactively. Potential trouble areas need to be identified early and dealt with quickly and appropriately so a project doesn't go over budget, miss deadlines, or negatively affect an organization's reputation. IT project managers can plan effectively for handling the possibility of negative outcomes by following a risk management process. Such a process can help them monitor and control risks throughout a project's life cycle. This course describes the steps in a risk management process for IT projects – from identifying the risks and documenting them, to analyzing and developing appropriate and effective responses.",project management,IT Project Management Essentials,0.8466446
,IT Project Management Essentials: Testing Deliverables and Closing IT Projects,"Because it's a significant point in an IT project, the closing phase has its own set of processes and activities. When a project manager carries out those activities and processes, he or she can demonstrate that the project goal has been met and provide the team with a sense of accomplishment. In addition, carrying out the final tasks of a project, particularly the task of archiving documentation, ensures that lessons learned are gathered and stored for the future. An orderly conclusion also helps guarantee that end users' needs and expectations have been met and that stakeholders are satisfied. This course describes the closing activities for IT projects, covering how to test IT project deliverables to make sure they meet requirements, which activities help close an IT project effectively, and how to set up maintenance and support.",project management,IT Project Management Essentials,0.68518394
,Managing Software Project Outsourcing: Preparing to Manage an Outsourced Project,"Outsourcing is a powerful business strategy that can bring many benefits. These include lower costs, an ability to focus on core business competencies, improved quality, and superior skills and capabilities. IT outsourcing has gained in popularity over the years, and it seems likely to continue doing so. This course focuses on a particular type of IT outsourcing – namely, software project outsourcing. It describes the areas in software development that are typically outsourced, and explains some of the models for outsourcing, including cloud computing. With the aim of helping to prepare the learner for managing an outsourced project, the course outlines the managerial implications of working on this type of project – for example, the need to shift from managing activities to managing outcomes and building cooperation and collaboration across the miles. It also describes how to define your needs and requirements through a statement of work and how to plan effective governance so that your project's objectives are met successfully.",outsourcing,Managing Software Project Outsourcing,0.98365974
,Managing Software Project Outsourcing: Developing a Vendor Contract,"To successfully outsource a software project, you need to pick a vendor who knows what to do, how to do it, how well to do it, and how quickly to do it. Vendor selection can be a complex process that involves defining detailed requirements, developing a business model and delivery model, creating a request for proposal, assessing and selecting vendors, and negotiating and finalizing a contract. This course describes key actions that can help you develop an effective vendor contract. It explains how to create a comprehensive request for proposal - one that's designed to get you the information you need about potential suppliers for your outsourced project.

In this course, you'll learn how to begin the outsourcing relationship positively by being clear about expectations, and preparing your in-house team for the transition to working with the outsourced team. The course also explains key issues to tackle during this transition phase, including training, knowledge transfer, and issue resolution. In addition, it describes how to communicate effectively with the outsourced team and how to address cultural and time zone issues so that you can develop and maintain a positive relationship with your team of outsourcers.",outsourcing,Managing Software Project Outsourcing,0.9759601
,Managing Software Project Outsourcing: Dealing with Risks,"Every outsourcing initiative has its risks. These can include the discovery of a strategic mismatch with the vendor, security breaches or loss of intellectual property, and the failure of the outsourced team to implement the project on time or within scope and budget. Risk arises throughout a project – from strategic assessment, through planning, implementation, and close. Being aware of the risks and planning your responses can help you manage a successful outsourced project. This course explains how to assess risks by first identifying them and then determining how likely they are to occur and how significant an impact they would have. It describes the key issues to address in a risk control plan, including the risk responses to be applied and the people responsible for taking action. And it presents best practices for reducing risks in an outsourcing relationship.",outsourcing,Managing Software Project Outsourcing,0.9815362
,Managing Projects within Organizations (PMBOK® Guide Fifth Edition),"
Project-based operations have become the norm in today's business world. In essence, almost every work effort is a project, from constructing a new building to designing and delivering a new information management system. As projects become the primary method for getting things done and effecting organizational change, it is crucial to choose a good and proven method for managing projects. However, projects cannot be properly managed in a silo.

,Green Business: Implementing Sustainability Strategies,"A plan for implementing a sustainability strategy stands a much greater chance of success if the essential players in an organization back it.

Knowing the type of metrics you'll be collecting can help you plan the methods you'll use to report on your sustainability initiatives. These two considerations are as important as the physical implementation of the plan itself.   This course covers ways to align corporate and sustainability strategies, as well as ways to measure your sustainability performance. It provides examples of how companies can implement sustainability strategies and discusses the importance of reporting sustainability results accurately.  The way that companies market their sustainability efforts is also important to consider.

,Überblick Projektmanagement (PMBOK® Guide – Fünfte Ausgabe),"Jedes Projekt ist anders. Manche sind klein und unkompliziert. Andere wiederum sind groß und komplex. Die meisten liegen irgendwo dazwischen. Obwohl jedes Projekt einzigartig ist, weisen alle bestimmte gemeinsame Eigenschaften auf. Jedes Projekt hat einen ähnlichen Lebenszyklus, der mit einer Idee beginnt, eine Entwicklung durchläuft und in der Lieferung eines fertigen Produkts oder einer Dienstleistung seinen Abschluss findet. Ein Produkt hat einen eigenen Lebenszyklus, der zwar in den Projektlebenszyklus eingebunden ist, aber dennoch Unterschiede aufweist. Alle Projekte haben ähnliche übergeordnete Phasen, wie etwa Beginn, Planung und Entwurf, Produktion und Abschluss. So weit so gut, aber welchen Bezug haben die Phasen eines Projekts zu den Phasen des Projektlebenszyklus? Nehmen die natürlichen Phasen eines Projekts Einfluss auf das Projektmanagement? Und welche Projektmanagementprozesse sollten in den jeweiligen Phasen angewendet werden? All das sind grundlegende Fragen, die sich Projektmanager stellen. Dieser Kurs beantwortet diese und andere Fragen. Er wurde konzipiert, um Projektmanagern und Projektteams ein fundiertes Verständnis von Projekten im Allgemeinen, von ihrer Struktur und von den Auswirkungen der Projektstruktur auf das Projektmanagement zu vermitteln.

,Geschäftskorrespondenz: Wirkungsvoll und leserorientiert schreiben,"Zu wissen, wer Ihre Leser sind, ist Voraussetzung für das Schreiben wirkungsvoller und angemessener Mitteilungen im Geschäftsleben. Wenden Sie sich an eine grÃ¶ÃŸere Anzahl von Adressaten oder an einen einzelnen Leser? Inwieweit sind die Leser mit dem Thema vertraut und an welchen Fragen sind sie hauptsÃ¤chlich interessiert? Dies sind nur einige Fragen, die Sie sich stellen sollten, bevor Sie zu schreiben beginnen. Es ist aber nicht nur wichtig, zu wissen, wer Ihre Adressaten sind, sondern auch, was der Zweck Ihrer Botschaft ist. Sollen Kunden Ã¼ber eine neue Strategie informiert werden oder mÃ¼ssen Sie Mitarbeiter von einer neuen Geschäftspraxis Ã¼berzeugen? Die Kenntnis des Zweckes wird Ihre Botschaft auf den Punkt bringen und so dem Leser klarmachen, warum sie für ihn wichtig ist. Zudem ist es leichter, in der geschÃ¤ftlichen Korrespondenz den richtigen Ton zu treffen, wenn Sie genau wissen, wer Ihre Adressaten sind und was Sie bezwecken. Beim Schreiben ist der Ton ein wichtiges Element, das Einfluss darauf hat, wie der Leser auf Ihre Botschaft reagiert. Der Begriff Ton oder Tonfall bezieht sich hier auf die Haltung des Verfassers gegenäber dem Leser und dem Thema. Diese Haltung dräckt sich in der Art und Weise, wie die Botschaft geschrieben ist, aus. Haben Sie schon einmal eine Nachricht erhalten, deren Ton Sie verÃ¤rgert hat? Vielleicht war er herablassend oder zu vertraulich. Am besten kÃ¶nnen Sie den Tonfall beim Schreiben kontrollieren, indem Sie sich in den Leser hineinversetzen. AuÃŸerdem mÃ¼ssen die Worte, die den richtigen Ton für die Botschaft bewirken sollen, sorgfÃ¤ltig gewÃ¤hlt sein. Wenn Sie wissen, wer Ihre Leser sind und was Sie bezwecken, dann kÃ¶nnen Sie Ihren Tonfall entsprechend darauf einstellen. Das wird Ihnen dabei helfen, eine erfolgreichere GeschÃ¤ftskorrespondenz zu verfassen. Dieser Kurs zeigt Ihnen MÃ¶glichkeiten, wie Sie feststellen kÃ¶nnen, wer Ihre Adressaten sind und wie Sie Botschaften schreiben, die für unterschiedliche Leser den jeweils richtigen Ton treffen. Er zeigt zudem, wie erfolgreiches Schreiben funktioniert, wenn man die HauptgrÃ¼nde für das Schreiben geschÃ¤ftlicher Korrespondenz betrachtet, als da sind zu informieren, zu reagieren oder zu Ã¼berzeugen.

,Diplomacy and Tact for Every Day,"Imagine a world where people always say what's on their mind with no filters. This is a world where you are informed at a lunch meeting that you have lettuce in your teeth, where it's announced at the staff meeting that a project has been delayed because you forgot to send an e-mail, or where your coworkers openly roll their eyes when you ask a question they think is embarrassingly basic. This is a world without diplomacy and tact. Utilizing tact and diplomacy is important when engaging in difficult conversations, but these skills are just as important in our day-to-day work environments. People who communicate with diplomacy and tact will be notable and noticed for their ability to communicate across all levels of an organization in a way that puts people at ease and inspires confidence. In this course, you'll explore diplomacy and tact, and recognize the difference between them and the value they bring to you and your work environment. You'll also review situational awareness, how to choose words to avoid a meltdown, and how to apologize with grace.",soft skills,,0.8147371

,Connecting with Others through Diplomacy and Tact,"Communication is connecting. Connecting requires insights into others' minds. The first step in connecting with sensitivity is seeing others as fully human. We should recognize that an egocentric perspective can be a barrier to bridging the distance between ourselves and others. Another barrier to communication is failing to recognize that our way of seeing the world is not the only way; we can't assume those we're communicating with see things the same way. It's also important to understand how our biases, stereotypes, and expert knowledge can become barriers to effective communication.

,Measuring and Modeling Relationships between Variables in Six Sigma,"
As a Six Sigma team moves into the Analyze stage of the DMAIC process, it looks more closely at the variables and variable interrelationships identified during the Measure stage. As part of the analysis, a scatter diagram of dependent and independent variables is drawn to visualize the form, strength, and direction of their relationships. By determining their correlation coefficient, a linear relationship can be quantified and identified as positive, negative, or neutral. Then, using regression analysis, a model is developed to describe the relationship as a linear equation and then used for predictions and estimations. However, it is essential to analyze the uncertainty in the estimate, to test that the relationship between variables is statistically significant, and that the model is valid. This course discusses two important tools – correlation and regression analysis for measuring and modeling relationships between variables. In terms of correlation, it takes learners through examples of scatter diagrams for two variables, the calculation and interpretation of the correlation coefficient, and the interpretation of its confidence interval. The course also draws learners' attention to some key considerations in correlation analysis, such as correlation and causation. In terms of regression analysis, the course discusses the simple linear regression model, how to create it using sample data, interpret and use it, and conduct a hypothesis test to check that the relationship between the variables is statistically significant. Finally, the course looks into how residual analysis is used to test the validity of the regression model. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.

,Multivariate Tools and Nonparametric Tests in Six Sigma,"
In the Analyze phase of the DMAIC methodology, a Six Sigma team begins to analyze the root causes of the problems that it identified in the earlier stages. This analysis may require churning out huge volumes of data of different types. Sometimes this data is of a multivariate nature, meaning that many dependent and independent variables need to be considered simultaneously. As such, Six Sigma teams often use advanced multivariate tools to manage this type of data. Another set of advanced statistical analysis tools used in this phase is nonparametric tests. In conventional hypothesis tests – called parametric tests – a sample statistic is obtained to estimate a population parameter and hence requires a number of assumptions to be made about the underlying population, such as the normality of data. However, a nonparametric test is used when some of these assumptions, such as normality of data, cannot be safely made. This course deals with multivariate and categorical data analysis tools such as factor analysis, discriminant analysis, and multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). The course also aims to familiarize learners with approaches for analyzing nonparametric data, particularly the use of Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests for validating hypotheses. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.

,Understanding DOE and Planning Experiments in Six Sigma,"
Six Sigma teams concluding the Analyze phase of DMAIC with a well-understood problem, strive to generate a powerful solution in the Improve phase. Design of experiments (DOE) is a controlled approach to experimentation that enables teams to systematically change the level of one or more input factors and observe the effects on the targeted response. If teams exercise care in choosing the right design – including suitable factors, levels, and responses – their experiments can reveal the precise combination of factors that will optimize the response. Later, that combination will be tested, validated, and ultimately implemented to effect the desired process improvement. This course surveys the concepts that are fundamental to design of experiments methodology. This course also explores the basic elements of experiments, principles of good experimental design, and strategies for designing experiments with desired power and resolution, and resource and time constraints. The focus is on the planning stage of DOE, when teams set experimental objectives, choose the best experimental design, and prepare to run the experiments. In describing these activities, the course explores the questions teams should consider at each stage of planning. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.

,Lean Improvement Methods and Implementation Planning in Six Sigma,"
As a Lean Six Sigma improvement team moves into the Improve phase of a DMAIC project, it begins to generate a list of solutions to address process problems. Lean offers several techniques to reduce waste and cycle time, as well as improvement tools such as kaizen, theory of constraints, and overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). After appropriate methods and tools are used and solutions developed, the implementation of proposed solutions needs to be tested and verified to ensure that optimal choices are made. This course looks at some of the popular Lean methods and implementation planning in Six Sigma. It examines Lean tools used for reducing waste and cycle time, and the Japanese principles of continuous improvement – kaizen and kaizen blitz. It also looks at some other process improvement methodologies such as theory of constraints and OEE. Finally, the course examines planning for proposed solutions, including conducting pilot tests and simulations.

,Using Lean Control Tools and Maintaining Controls in Six Sigma,"
In the final stages of the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology, teams need to control the improved processes in order to sustain improvement gains. Process control includes applying tools to continuously monitor and maintain each improved process, and to prevent it from reverting to its previous state. Apart from the statistical process control, there are a number of other Six Sigma and Lean tools to help to this end. This course introduces basic control tools commonly used in Lean Six Sigma projects. Specifically, it explores how total productive maintenance (TPM) promotes shared responsibility for maintaining process gains, and how the visual controls provide at-a-glance information about process performance. In addition, this course highlights the need to re-analyze the measurement system after improvement solutions are implemented, and provides guidelines for drawing conclusions from this. It tours the key elements of a vital tool for maintaining controls – the control plan – and explores the steps for developing an effective plan.
