It is crucial that the costs and risks, as well as the tasks assigned to each party, are clearly communicated. Disputes can easily arise if trading partners have a different understanding of who is incurring costs for insurance and carriage or who is arranging which part of the transportation process. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has published rules, called ‘Incoterms’, which govern the delivery and the transportation of goods. These terms have gained widespread commercial and legal acceptance across the globe. This tutorial provides an overview of the latest version of these rules (Incoterms 2010), including their application and practical use.

An Introduction","Description":"Inflation-Linked Instruments:\nInflation-linked instruments are securities and derivatives used by entities such as banks, corporates and sovereigns to protect their assets and liabilities against the risk of inflation. Inflation-linked securities (linkers) are bonds that pay investors a fixed rate plus an amount tied to an inflation index, thus protecting the investor's return against inflation. Inflation derivatives have many uses including transferring inflation risk, optimizing market timing, hedging portfolios, creating synthetic securities and conducting arbitrage. Most inflation derivatives are in the form of inflation swaps in which one counterparty pays a fixed rate in exchange for a payment tied to an inflation index. Other types of inflation derivative are inflation options and inflation futures.

In practice, however, there are a number of factors that affect interest calculations. The impact of these factors can make a significant difference to the growth of an asset or liability under different interest rate environments. The difference in interest payable on different calculation bases is not negligible - in financial markets, a basis point differential, or even a fraction of a basis point, can be crucial in getting a deal done. This tutorial looks at the subject of interest calculations in detail, beginning with simple and compound interest before moving on to more tricky calculations involving the comparison of investments with different compounding and day count bases.

The concept was boosted significantly by the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the early 1990s. After a relatively slow start, ETFs have subsequently grown to become a worldwide phenomenon.In line with increases in both the number and size of ETFs, the complexity and sophistication of the funds has also grown. For the first decade or so of their existence, ETFs were based almost exclusively on benchmark stock indices. Sector-based ETFs then emerged, while diversification into new asset classes – such as fixed income, real estate, and commodities – gathered pace. The next generation included more controversial products such as leveraged and actively managed ETFs, while new and innovative structures continue to emerge from ETF sponsors today.Topics covered in this course include: The creation and redemption process for ETFs The key features of ETFs that makes them such an attractive investment vehicle for many investors The evolution of the ETF market and its development worldwide The different types of equity (stock) ETFs, from traditional broad market index funds to more contemporary smart beta ETFs Other ETF asset classes, including fixed income (bond), commodity, real estate, and currency exchange-traded products","Topic":"Business, Finance, and Accountancy","Subject Area":"","Score":"0.5277133"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"The Volcker Rule (Level 1,2) 2016 (15-30 mins) (Retake)","Description":"The purpose of this module is to introduce all Barclays' employees to the requirements of complying with the Volker Rule under Dodd-Frank.

However, margin plays a different role in the derivatives market, in effect acting as a 'good faith deposit' to ensure that an option writer or futures trader meets their contractual obligations should the market turn against them. This tutorial looks at the three main types of margin: ownership margin, as used in the securities market, options margin, and futures margin.

These securities help these entities raise capital for various public purposes – such as building schools, highways, hospitals, and other special projects. A primary feature of many municipal securities is that the interest received by investors is generally exempt from federal income tax, and may also be exempt from state and local taxes. The market for munis received a huge boost in 2009 with the introduction of Build America Bonds (BABs) as part of President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate the economy and create new jobs. This tutorial provides a broad overview of the municipal bond market, focusing on the main features and issuers of these instruments and the regulatory bodies and legislation relevant to the market.

These investors are primarily attracted by the fact that interest payments on most munis are exempt from federal taxation, and may also be free from state taxation if the investor is resident in the same state as the bond issuer. This tutorial describes the main investor groups in municipal bonds and the features of these securities that are attractive to them. The risks of investing in munis and the tax issues relevant to bondholders are also discussed.Prerequisite Knowledge Municipal Bonds (US) Types Tutorial Level: Intermediate Tutorial Duration: 60 mins","Topic":"mutual funds","Subject Area":"Banking industry and markets","Score":"0.8882676"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"FHL Accounts","Description":"","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Networking","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"BCD Collections BPS - 5343 knowledge checker 2017","Description":"","Topic":"","Subject Area":"New to Barclays","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"Municipal Bonds (US) - Types","Description":"Municipal Bonds (US):\nThere are two main types of municipal bond – general obligation, or GO, bonds and revenue bonds.

A more recent addition to the municipal bond ‘family’ is the Build America Bond (BAB), introduced in 2009 to provide an economic stimulus to flagging municipalities.

Many alternative assets exhibit a low (or negative) correlation with traditional asset classes, thus providing investors with opportunities for improved portfolio diversification and enhanced returns.

Barrier options can help in this regard. The most common forms of barrier option are simple 'knock-in' or knock-out' structures where an option either comes into existence (or else is extinguished) if the price of some reference asset moves above or below a 'barrier' level. Since the existence of the barrier always reduces the possibility of exercise, the barrier option will be cheaper than a vanilla call or put. However, the pricing and trading of these instruments can be far from straightforward. This tutorial describes the different forms of barrier option, how they are used, and how they are priced and managed.

New markets and products represent new profit opportunities, and instruments were quickly developed covering a wide number of asset classes. However, the natural commoditization of products quickly reduced profit margins, with the result that financial intermediaries sought non-standard, 'exotic' areas where rewards might be greater.  This tutorial outlines the appetite for the growth of 'exotic' options. Rather than attempting to describe an exhaustive list of structures (almost an impossible task due to the fecundity of investment bankers' imaginations), the tutorial illustrates the non-standard ways in which an instrument can be developed. Some of the pricing and risk management issues are also examined.

It is also incorporated into option models through a 'volatility' term. However, the historic estimation and the use of volatility as a pricing input are very different things.

The management of options, particularly the management of option portfolios, is complicated by these multiple sensitivities. A key phrase for market participants is 'dynamic hedging'; unlike some other financial instruments, hedging and management of option portfolios requires constant vigilance. Awareness of the various changes in value due to market movements is essential. The two tutorials in this series provide definitions of each of the key sensitivities, and show the calculations for values in terms of the theoretical continuous-time Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The tutorials also show how these values change with respect to common variables such as time and strike price. Finally, 'real world' adjustments to the theoretical values are examined in order for those sensitivities to be useful to an option participant. The first of the tutorials focuses on delta and gamma.

They are an interesting example of the way in which structurers can exploit the difference between the 'risk-neutral' assumptions underlying the derivative market and the more prevalent assumptions that exist in the 'real world'. The risk-neutral framework generates implied forwards in the USD/JPY FX market which, given the market interest rate differential, are very different from today's spot levels - different enough to be attractive. While the instrument itself is well understood, and has been issued in such quantities that it is almost considered a 'vanilla' instrument amongst investors, the structuring and hedging of a PRDC note is highly complex. This tutorial tackles many of these complexities by examining in detail the structures and risks associated with these notes. Prerequisite Knowledge Prior to studying this tutorial, you should have a good understanding of interest rate derivatives, FX derivatives, and the structured note markets.

As well as allowing borrowers to attain highly attractive below-market funding, these instruments also rewarded investors as long as interest rates remained low. This tutorial looks at range accrual structures in detail, examining their features and characteristics and showing how to price these instruments.

This tutorial examines in detail the main elements of the securitization process, providing information on a variety of topics including the main players involved in the process, the construction of the securities, and the motivations for a securitization.

A CDO deal is broken into multiple tranches, each with separate maturity and credit risk, appealing to different classes of investors. Various forms of credit enhancement are used and CDO tranches are rated by the main credit rating agencies. CDOs represented the fastest growing segment of the securitization market in the years leading up to the global financial crisis of 2007/9. This tutorial explains how CDOs are issued and structured, and outlines the common issuer and investor motivations for entering CDO deals.

They differ crucially in the way collateral is used to generate cash flows to pay noteholders, in how the structure is credit-enhanced, and in how the underlying collateral pool is managed. The ratings process for these structures also differs. In this tutorial, we will examine the structural differences between cash flow and market value CDOs. We will also observe how these instruments are rated, which is crucial to the pricing of a CDO. Finally, we will look at some commonly used exotic CDO structures.

The trader usually just enters the details of the trade into a computer system and any payments, transfer of securities, and documentation are all automatically processed. Swaps, however, are generally long-term contracts that generate substantial credit exposure, so they require documentation describing the way defaults can occur and any actions pursuant to such a default. There are multiple, unique, cash flows over many years. Making these payments is more complex than a simple transfer of funds. At various times in the past, the combination of complex transactions and the explosive growth of the market has caused a logjam at financial institutions - they have been unable to get documentation out in time. Moreover, as the market has developed, legal problems have moved from the realm of anticipation to realization. This tutorial describes the complexities and evolution of the swap settlement and documentation processes. It covers the trade cycle, the participants, and the standard documentation.

In-arrears swaps are used to speculate on changes in the shape of the yield curve and are particularly well suited to steep yield curve environments. This tutorial looks at how in-arrears swaps are structured and describes in detail how they are priced. Other topics, such as price sensitivities and hedging, are also covered.

The floating rate is linked to a published overnight interbank call money index. The term of an OIS typically ranges from two days to two years, but can extend beyond this if required. Overnight indexed swaps are used primarily to manage the interest rate risk on overnight rates. They are also used to speculate on movements in these rates. The importance of these swaps is derived from their impact on activity at the shortest end of the yield curve - the overnight (O/N) rate. This allows market participants to manage overnight interest rate risk, promoting better leverage and liquidity, mitigating credit risk and lowering transaction costs and capital charges. This tutorial looks at overnight indexed swaps in detail, examining their features, markets, and characteristics, and showing how to price these structures.

While targeted redemption has been most prominent in the interest rate world, a structured note in any asset class can be a TARN. Valuing a TARN is complex, due to the path dependency of the structure. The high degree of path dependency means that a fairly sophisticated model needs to be used to value a TARN, even if the underlying coupons are fairly simple. In this tutorial, we will study the distinctive characteristics of TARNs. We will also look into the widespread applicability of the TARN concept. Finally, we will identify the valuation difficulties and analyze the approach taken to solving them.

In addition, the crisis underlined the need for regulators to address not simply capital adequacy but also liquidity and leverage. This is what is being done through the development and implementation of Basel III. This tutorial explains in detail how Basel III changes the nature of previous capital adequacy regimes. It also examines other areas addressed by Basel III, such as liquidity standards and leverage rules.

The size and nature of the losses, and the need to enlist government support to prevent bank failures, quickly galvanized the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the regulatory community to rethink the capital adequacy rules and minimum ratios (among other issues). This tutorial describes the changes to the capital requirements under Basel III, including the tighter definition of qualifying capital and increased focus on CET1, the new capital buffers, and the revised minimum ratios. The impact of these changes on banks' capital structures are explored, as are the implementation issues during the transition period.

Prerequisite Knowledge Prior to studying this tutorial, you should have a sound understanding of caps and floors and how they are priced. An understanding of barrier options and the binomial option pricing model would also be beneficial. You can learn about these concepts in the following tutorials: Caps & Floors - An Introduction Caps & Floors - Pricing Options - Barrier Options Options - Future Asset Prices & Volatility Options - Replication, Risk-Neutrality, & Black-Scholes Options - Beyond Black-Scholes Tutorial Level: Advanced: Tutorial Duration: 90 minutes","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Banking industry and markets","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"Caps & Floors - Chooser & Double-Strike Structures (IFMCFCDS) INACTIVE DO NOT USE","Description":"","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Banking industry and markets","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"CA-Q1-2015","Description":"CA-Q1-2015\n","Topic":"Cannot be determined","Subject Area":"","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"CA-Q1-2015 (Retake)","Description":"CA-Q1-2015 (Retake)","Topic":"Business, Finance, and Accountancy","Subject Area":"","Score":"0.9452391"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"CA-Q2-2015","Description":"CA-Q2-2015","Topic":"Cannot be determined","Subject Area":"","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"CA-Q3-2014","Description":"CA-Q3-2014\n","Topic":"Cannot be determined","Subject Area":"","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"CA-Q4-2014","Description":"CA-Q4-2014\n","Topic":"Cannot be determined","Subject Area":"","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"CA-R85-Q2-2015","Description":"CA-R85-Q2-2015","Topic":"Cannot be determined","Subject Area":"","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"Impact Investing Accessible Document","Description":"This PDF document is the accessible version of the Impact Investing module.

From the point of view of stakeholders or investors, the distinction is important because mandatory events require no action on their behalf. Voluntary corporate actions, on the other hand, are those where investors opt to participate in the event or not. From the point of view of custodians and other participants involved in the corporate actions processing chain, the distinction is important because voluntary actions are generally more complex and hence involve greater risk. To complicate things even further, there are also a number of mandatory actions with options, where investors are required to make a choice among some alternatives offered to them as part of a mandatory corporate action. This tutorial looks at the main types of corporate action - mandatory, voluntary, and mandatory with options.

To some extent, you can think of a documentary collection as an international ‘cash on delivery’ method of payment. The buyer either pays for goods at delivery or gives an undertaking to pay for them in the future by signing an enclosed draft or bill of exchange. However, there are a couple of crucial distinctions between a typical cash on delivery transaction and a documentary collection. This tutorial describes how documentary collections work, distinguishes the different types, outlines the role of the parties involved, and lists the benefits and drawbacks of this method of payment. It also explains the Uniform Rules for Collections (URC), the internationally recognized rules covering collection operations for documentary collections.

However, non-'buy-and-hold' investors that buy and sell bonds prior to maturity are exposed to many risks, most significantly interest rate volatility (bond prices and yields/interest rates are inversely related). Duration and convexity - the subject of this tutorial - are important concepts used in measuring the price volatility of a bond, or its price sensitivity with respect to a change in its yield.

The more volatile an asset, the more difficult it is to predict where its price might be on a future date, and hence the greater the risk associated with the asset. Volatility reached unprecedented levels in many markets in 2008 and huge losses were incurred by many market participants. This tutorial looks at the concept of volatility and how it is assessed and estimated, with particular emphasis on the market volatility of 2008.

Although it has been around since 1963, the Eurobond market is still in the relatively early days of its evolution (the first US government securities were authorized way back in 1790). The introduction of the euro has given it a further impetus and it is generally expected that the market will develop and grow even further in the coming years.

As a result, when the global financial and economic crisis erupted in 2007, Asian economies were well positioned to avoid its worst effects. The learning experience gleaned from the region's own financial crisis nearly a decade earlier helped Asia emerge relatively unscathed. Notably, most banks in the region were not heavily exposed to distressed markets for structured credit products and other toxic securities. A number of institutions actually seized the opportunity to acquire assets at fire-sale prices. The expectation is that Basel– the new global capital standards – is unlikely to \nbe too onerous for most Asian banks due to their reasonable core capital buffers, modest reliance on hybrid capital, and generally good liquidity. This tutorial describes the regulatory framework and the key financial authorities operating in four major Asian economies – Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

The existence of a two-tier European economy became more apparent, with dire problems in peripheral countries standing in stark contrast to the performance of core economies. European governments and financial authorities, fresh from dealing with the financial crisis, now faced an even bigger problem as the very existence of the euro was threatened. This tutorial looks at the key European financial authorities, including the role played by the European Central Bank (ECB) in implementing monetary policy for the entire euro area. The participants in the EU's revamped supervisory framework, the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), are also described in detail. Finally, the tutorial takes a look at some of the key EU financial markets directives, many of which were introduced or revised due to events in recent years.Prerequisite Knowledge Banking Regulation – An Introduction Tutorial Level: Introductory Tutorial Duration: 75 mins","Topic":"regulatory","Subject Area":"Banking industry and markets","Score":"0.9413969"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"Financial Authorities (UK) INACTIVE DO NOT USE","Description":"","Topic":"financial management","Subject Area":"Banking industry and markets","Score":"0.80566204"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"Financial Authorities (US)","Description":"Regulatory Environment:\nFinancial regulation in the US is a complex affair, with the various sectors of the financial markets regulated by numerous agencies and other entities. For many years, regulation was relatively loose, which yielded space for innovation and expansion in the banking sector. Banks took full advantage and profits soared. A number of institutions became too big to fail.The financial crisis brought the era of lax regulatory standards to a crashing halt. Banks, and their regulation (or lack of), became front page news. Gaps and weaknesses in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry were laid bare for all to see. The US government responded by introducing the most sweeping set of reforms to the regulatory landscape since the aftermath of the Great Depression.This tutorial looks at the structure of the US regulatory environment and the role of the various key regulators. It also describes the massive changes that have come about as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and consumer Protection Act of 2010.
