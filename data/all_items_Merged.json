They require banks to maintain an adequate capital level at all times in order to cover their aggregate risk. A number of approaches are used for identifying and measuring risk, then planning the capital requirement for the bank based on that risk.   This course provides an overview of various approaches used for capital planning. More specifically, it presents components of the standardized measurement approach, the IRB approach, and the advanced IRB approach. It also aims to identify market risk and the capital requirement to cover that risk. Finally, the course outlines the risk-adjusted return on capital to quantify the amount of capital necessary to support all of a bank's operating activities.","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Project Management","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"Basel II and Basel III: An Overview","Description":"Developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the latest Basel regulations – Basel II and Basel III – represent decades of comprehensive global banking reforms. The aim of Basel II and Basel III is to strengthen the stability of the international banking system. Basel II is based on three mutually reinforcing pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review process, as well as market discipline and disclosure requirements. Its key goal is to determine the minimum level of capital banks need to maintain to cover the risks they're exposed to in their lending and investment activities. Considered a major overhaul of Basel II, Basel III requires stronger capital and liquidity standards to be accompanied by better risk management and supervision by banks. Basel III endeavors to plug any gaps that were present in Basel II and also attempts to strengthen the regulations promoted by Basel II.  This course gives an overview of Basel II and Basel III; the factors that led to the two accords, objectives, key approaches, and differences between them. It focuses on how various Basel regulations help banks become stronger and better managers of their risks. The course goes on to discuss the three pillars of Basel II and its approaches for measuring capital requirements for credit, operational, and market risk. Finally, the course outlines key features of Basel III, its differences and improvements over Basel II, and some key components of its global implementation and timeline.","Topic":"banking","Subject Area":"Agile Project Management Fundamentals (PMI_ACP Certification aligned)","Score":"0.76844966"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"End-to-End Supply Network (E2ESN) Pillar Overview","Description":"This course provides an overview of This course provides an overview of the IL6S End-to-End Supply Network Pillar\r\nthe IL6S End-to-End Supply Network Pillar\r\n\r\nFor assistance with MIU Learning Catalogue issues, our support process is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIf you experience an issue once inside the MIU Learning Catalogue, please refer to the Learning Catalogue Troubleshooting Guide (English only) or contact your HR Representative as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n          o    In countries supported by MBS Employee Services, please open an Online HR Request using category:  My Career / Learning & Development (MIU)\r\n\r\n          o    In countries NOT supported by MBS Employee Services, please contact your local HR Solutions team. \r\n\r\n-     If your HR Representative cannot resolve the issue, they will communicate with the Global Learning Management team on your behalf.","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Functional Expertise","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"Focused Improvement (FI) Pillar Overview","Description":"This course provides an overview of the IL6S Focused Improvement Pillar\r\n\r\nFor assistance with MIU Learning Catalogue issues, our support process is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIf you experience an issue once inside the MIU Learning Catalogue, please refer to the Learning Catalogue Troubleshooting Guide (English only) or contact your HR Representative as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n          o    In countries supported by MBS Employee Services, please open an Online HR Request using category:  My Career / Learning & Development (MIU)\r\n\r\n          o    In countries NOT supported by MBS Employee Services, please contact your local HR Solutions team. \r\n\r\n-     If your HR Representative cannot resolve the issue, they will communicate with the Global Learning Management team on your behalf.","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Functional Expertise","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"Being At My Best – Personal Resourcefulness","Description":"An interactive live face to face session on the core foundations of Being @ My Best - including Me/Us/It, Check-ins, being In/Out of the box, and ETC (how to get out of the box).\r\n\r\nThis session enables participants to go deeper in reflecting, and practicing the tools linked to personal resourcefulness.\r\n\r\nPost session materials will be posted on your Recommendations in your Learning Plan upon full completion of the program for you to download and access.","Topic":"","Subject Area":"Being at My Best","Score":"Score < threshold"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"Project 2013 Level 2","Description":"This course teaches advanced commands and features of Microsoft Project 2013.

The PRINCE2 project management system is no exception. Its framework consists of seven distinctive processes that define the management activities of a project's life cycle. They encompass all activities related to starting up, directing, initiating, controlling, managing a stage boundary and closing a project. The seven processes provide a consistent set of guidelines that represent the minimum requirements for a properly managed project. They may be applied to various types of projects and are completely scalable to projects of any size.  PRINCE2 is recognized as an international standard for process-based project management. It is the standard method for project management in the UK.

Processes provide a controlling structure for establishing what to do and when to do it. The bulk of the project work is done during the stage-related processes, when Stage Plans are implemented and product creation and delivery is monitored, controlled and reported. Once the final product is signed off and delivered to the customer, there are also specific processes around ensuring the project comes to a complete and controlled close.   This course provides an overview of the PRINCE2™ processes related to controlling, managing and closing a project.

One of the defining characteristics of a project is that it is unique. Each project has a different team, a different customer, and a different location. And typically each product is unique in some way as well. Projects differ in terms of scale, complexity and culture. They can be a stand-alone entity or part of a programme of related projects. The key point is that there is a multitude of factors that affect how your project should be managed. As a result, there is no such thing as 'one size fits all' project management. The good news is that PRINCE2 can be tailored to suit any project environment you might work in. PRINCE2 is a flexible framework that can be tailored to any type or size of project.  PRINCE2 is recognized as an international standard for process-based project management. It is the standard method for project management in the UK. This course is designed to assist learners in preparation for the PRINCE2 Foundation certification exam objectives. In particular this course focuses on the general approach to tailoring a project and what's involved in tailoring; it also focuses on how to tailor PRINCE2 to suit different project environments including projects in a programme, simple projects, commercial customer/supplier environment type projects as well as multiorganizational projects.     ----------------------------------------------------    PRINCE2® is a registered trade mark of AXELOS Limited.","Topic":"project management","Subject Area":"","Score":"0.89529395"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"Getting Started with Safari","Description":"This course introduces you to Safari - Apple's innovative, fast, and full-featured web browser.

How well an employee meets requirements set by the boss determines whether that employee succeeds or fails, receives rewards or penalties, and earns praise or criticism. On another level however, the judgment of an external boss isn't enough to make a job personally fulfilling and rewarding. That's something all employees of an organization decide for themselves. Everyone who works must also answer to an inner boss, a personal, internal voice that provides guidance on whether a job is worth doing and whether it is done well.

This module explores how these internal voices affect our attitude, our behaviour, and our impact in the world.\r\n\r\nThis module invites you to explore your own self talk, reflect on your own experiences and connect with what is real in the present moment, your Realist voice.\r\n\r\nReminders:\r\n\r\n• When using Internet Explorer version 11, we highly recommend the following steps:\r\n\r\n1.Turn off the \"Display intranet sites in Compatibility View\" under Compatibility View settings\r\n2.Clear cookies and Cache then re-start Internet Explorer\r\n3.Turn Off pop-up blocker\r\n\r\n• When using Android Internet Browser, we highly recommend that the  version of your Internet Browser is 5.0 and up to ensure all functionalities will work.\r\n• For Android Google Chrome users, clicking ‘Download and Print’ will automatically place the document in Chrome's download history.\r\n• For IOS devices (iPhone and iPads),  please use Safari as this is the preferred and supported browser for SuccessFactors LMS.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor assistance with MIU Learning Catalogue issues, our support process is as follows:\r\n\r\n-        If you experience an issue once inside the MIU Learning Catalogue, please refer to the Learning Catalogue Troubleshooting Guide (English only) or contact your HR Representative as follows:\r\n\r\n          o    In countries supported by MBS Employee Services, please open an Online HR Request using category:  My Career / Learning & Development (MIU)\r\n\r\n          o    In countries NOT supported by MBS Employee Services, please contact your local HR Solutions team. \r\n\r\n-     If your HR Representative cannot resolve the issue, they will communicate with the Global Learning Management team on your behalf.","Topic":"Information Technology","Subject Area":"","Score":"0.24122111"},{"Entity Type":"","Title":"Being at my Best: Personal Resourcefulness - E.T.C.","Description":"Set yourself free from the box!

Or if the individuals in your team are performing at their peak? Using a performance management system is vital to help ensure that the performance of individuals and teams produces the desired outcomes for organizational success. Having a performance management system in place can focus attention on results that count, boost productivity, align team and individual activities with organizational goals, and improve morale.   After explaining the nature and benefits of performance management, this course outlines the five phases of a performance management system: planning, monitoring, improving, reviewing, and rewarding. It then explains what you need to do in the planning phase. It shows you how to recognize critical success factors and develop key performance indicators based on these. Then it guides you in collaborating with employees to create role profiles that can generate meaningful performance agreements.

This course shows you how to monitor and improve your employees' performance using a four-step process that covers setting targets, collecting the necessary information, analyzing that information, and responding to performance gaps that appear. It first helps you identify appropriate targets and standards against which you can measure performance.

It is also the phase when the 'shoulds and ought-tos' bubble to the surface - the things that a Coachee is unconsciously following, instead of their true aspirations. These 'shoulds and ought-tos come from outside the coachee, and it is in this phase that they must be dealt with, by either eliminating them or figuring out a way to deal with them. Towards the end of this phase, the coachee is clicking along and it's time to 'fire' their coach. The coach is no longer needed as the goals of the engagement are creating the coachee's desired outcome.

This course examines several of the common methodologies utilized in Design for Six Sigma (DFSS), beginning with the two common counterparts to the DMAIC methodology: DMADV and DMADOV. Design for X is emerging as an important knowledge-based multifunctional approach to design that is aimed at particular prioritized process constraints, such as cost, manufacturability, testability, or maintainability. This course explores several constraints in more detail, offering strategies for achieving designs concentrated on the chosen criteria. Another recently developed approach, robust design, uses parameter and tolerance control to produce designs which will be reliable during manufacturing and while in use. This course will address the basic aims of parameter control, tolerance design, and statistical tolerancing.

The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI® Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas. The course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

Dies sind nur einige Fragen, die Sie sich stellen sollten, bevor Sie zu schreiben beginnen.

Sollen Kunden Ã¼ber eine neue Strategie informiert werden oder mÃ¼ssen Sie Mitarbeiter von einer neuen Geschäftspraxis Ã¼berzeugen? Die Kenntnis des Zweckes wird Ihre Botschaft auf den Punkt bringen und so dem Leser klarmachen, warum sie für ihn wichtig ist. Zudem ist es leichter, in der geschÃ¤ftlichen Korrespondenz den richtigen Ton zu treffen, wenn Sie genau wissen, wer Ihre Adressaten sind und was Sie bezwecken. Beim Schreiben ist der Ton ein wichtiges Element, das Einfluss darauf hat, wie der Leser auf Ihre Botschaft reagiert. Der Begriff Ton oder Tonfall bezieht sich hier auf die Haltung des Verfassers gegenäber dem Leser und dem Thema. Diese Haltung dräckt sich in der Art und Weise, wie die Botschaft geschrieben ist, aus. Haben Sie schon einmal eine Nachricht erhalten, deren Ton Sie verÃ¤rgert hat? Vielleicht war er herablassend oder zu vertraulich. Am besten kÃ¶nnen Sie den Tonfall beim Schreiben kontrollieren, indem Sie sich in den Leser hineinversetzen.
