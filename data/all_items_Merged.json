In practice, however, there are a number of factors that affect interest calculations. The impact of these factors can make a significant difference to the growth of an asset or liability under different interest rate environments. The difference in interest payable on different calculation bases is not negligible - in financial markets, a basis point differential, or even a fraction of a basis point, can be crucial in getting a deal done. This tutorial looks at the subject of interest calculations in detail, beginning with simple and compound interest before moving on to more tricky calculations involving the comparison of investments with different compounding and day count bases.

For the first decade or so of their existence, ETFs were based almost exclusively on benchmark stock indices.

Barrier options can help in this regard. The most common forms of barrier option are simple 'knock-in' or knock-out' structures where an option either comes into existence (or else is extinguished) if the price of some reference asset moves above or below a 'barrier' level. Since the existence of the barrier always reduces the possibility of exercise, the barrier option will be cheaper than a vanilla call or put. However, the pricing and trading of these instruments can be far from straightforward. This tutorial describes the different forms of barrier option, how they are used, and how they are priced and managed.

For example, the market assumptions are somewhat unrealistic, and the pricing formulas can only value a limited number of instruments.  This tutorial examines alternative numerical methods which allow option practitioners to value a wider range of instruments, and can also incorporate different price evolution assumptions.

New markets and products represent new profit opportunities, and instruments were quickly developed covering a wide number of asset classes. However, the natural commoditization of products quickly reduced profit margins, with the result that financial intermediaries sought non-standard, 'exotic' areas where rewards might be greater.  This tutorial outlines the appetite for the growth of 'exotic' options. Rather than attempting to describe an exhaustive list of structures (almost an impossible task due to the fecundity of investment bankers' imaginations), the tutorial illustrates the non-standard ways in which an instrument can be developed. Some of the pricing and risk management issues are also examined.

The management of options, particularly the management of option portfolios, is complicated by these multiple sensitivities. A key phrase for market participants is 'dynamic hedging'; unlike some other financial instruments, hedging and management of option portfolios requires constant vigilance. Awareness of the various changes in value due to market movements is essential. The two tutorials in this series provide definitions of each of the key sensitivities, and show the calculations for values in terms of the theoretical continuous-time Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The tutorials also show how these values change with respect to common variables such as time and strike price. Finally, 'real world' adjustments to the theoretical values are examined in order for those sensitivities to be useful to an option participant. The first of the tutorials focuses on delta and gamma.

There are multiple, unique, cash flows over many years. Making these payments is more complex than a simple transfer of funds. At various times in the past, the combination of complex transactions and the explosive growth of the market has caused a logjam at financial institutions - they have been unable to get documentation out in time. Moreover, as the market has developed, legal problems have moved from the realm of anticipation to realization. This tutorial describes the complexities and evolution of the swap settlement and documentation processes. It covers the trade cycle, the participants, and the standard documentation.

Forward swaps are used to take a view on forward interest rates, amortizing swaps are used to match the underlying principal to an amortizing loan, while zero-coupon swaps are useful if the floating rate receiver has a short-term cash flow deficit. In this tutorial, you will learn how each of these swap types is used, structured and priced.

The difference between the two relates to the floating rate payment. With a traditional swap, floating rate payments are based on the level of the reference index at the start of the interest period. With an in-arrears swap, floating rate payments are based on the level of the reference index rate at the end of the interest period. In-arrears swaps are used to speculate on changes in the shape of the yield curve and are particularly well suited to steep yield curve environments. This tutorial looks at how in-arrears swaps are structured and describes in detail how they are priced. Other topics, such as price sensitivities and hedging, are also covered.

While targeted redemption has been most prominent in the interest rate world, a structured note in any asset class can be a TARN. Valuing a TARN is complex, due to the path dependency of the structure. The high degree of path dependency means that a fairly sophisticated model needs to be used to value a TARN, even if the underlying coupons are fairly simple. In this tutorial, we will study the distinctive characteristics of TARNs. We will also look into the widespread applicability of the TARN concept. Finally, we will identify the valuation difficulties and analyze the approach taken to solving them.

From the point of view of stakeholders or investors, the distinction is important because mandatory events require no action on their behalf. Voluntary corporate actions, on the other hand, are those where investors opt to participate in the event or not. From the point of view of custodians and other participants involved in the corporate actions processing chain, the distinction is important because voluntary actions are generally more complex and hence involve greater risk. To complicate things even further, there are also a number of mandatory actions with options, where investors are required to make a choice among some alternatives offered to them as part of a mandatory corporate action. This tutorial looks at the main types of corporate action - mandatory, voluntary, and mandatory with options. Examples of each are provided, with the focus on the most popular events in the corporate actions marketplace.

To some extent, you can think of a documentary collection as an international ‘cash on delivery’ method of payment. The buyer either pays for goods at delivery or gives an undertaking to pay for them in the future by signing an enclosed draft or bill of exchange. However, there are a couple of crucial distinctions between a typical cash on delivery transaction and a documentary collection. This tutorial describes how documentary collections work, distinguishes the different types, outlines the role of the parties involved, and lists the benefits and drawbacks of this method of payment. It also explains the Uniform Rules for Collections (URC), the internationally recognized rules covering collection operations for documentary collections.

As a result, when the global financial and economic crisis erupted in 2007, Asian economies were well positioned to avoid its worst effects. The learning experience gleaned from the region's own financial crisis nearly a decade earlier helped Asia emerge relatively unscathed. Notably, most banks in the region were not heavily exposed to distressed markets for structured credit products and other toxic securities. A number of institutions actually seized the opportunity to acquire assets at fire-sale prices. The expectation is that Basel– the new global capital standards – is unlikely to \nbe too onerous for most Asian banks due to their reasonable core capital buffers, modest reliance on hybrid capital, and generally good liquidity. This tutorial describes the regulatory framework and the key financial authorities operating in four major Asian economies – Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

The existence of a two-tier European economy became more apparent, with dire problems in peripheral countries standing in stark contrast to the performance of core economies. European governments and financial authorities, fresh from dealing with the financial crisis, now faced an even bigger problem as the very existence of the euro was threatened. This tutorial looks at the key European financial authorities, including the role played by the European Central Bank (ECB) in implementing monetary policy for the entire euro area. The participants in the EU's revamped supervisory framework, the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), are also described in detail. Finally, the tutorial takes a look at some of the key EU financial markets directives, many of which were introduced or revised due to events in recent years.Prerequisite Knowledge Banking Regulation – An Introduction Tutorial Level: Introductory Tutorial Duration: 75 mins","Topic":"regulatory","Subject Area":"Banking industry and markets","Score":"0.9413969"},{"Entity Type":"Item","Title":"Financial Authorities (US)","Description":"Regulatory Environment:\nFinancial regulation in the US is a complex affair, with the various sectors of the financial markets regulated by numerous agencies and other entities.

A number of institutions became too big to fail.The financial crisis brought the era of lax regulatory standards to a crashing halt. Banks, and their regulation (or lack of), became front page news. Gaps and weaknesses in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry were laid bare for all to see. The US government responded by introducing the most sweeping set of reforms to the regulatory landscape since the aftermath of the Great Depression.This tutorial looks at the structure of the US regulatory environment and the role of the various key regulators.
